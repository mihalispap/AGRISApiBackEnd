	"abstract":{"value":"From the commercial extract of the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, two new diterpenoid glycosides were isolated besides the known steviol glycosides including stevioside, rebaudiosides A-F, rubusoside, and dulcoside A. The structures of the two new compounds were identified as 13-[(2-O-6-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (1), and 13-[(2-O-6-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (2), on the basis of extensive NMR and MS spectral data as well as chemical studies."}
