	"abstract":{"value":"The absolute configuration of the alpha-methylbutyryl residue in (4R,5S,7S,8S,9S,10R,11R,2''S)-7-angeloyloxy-9-hydroxy-8-(alpha-methylbutyryloxy)-longipin-2-en-L-one and (4R,5S,7S,8R,10R,11R,2''S)-7-angeloyloxy-8-(alpha-methylbutyryloxy)- longipin-2-en-L-one was determined by chemical correlation with (S)-(+)-benzyl alpha-methylbutyrate prepared from authentic (S)-(+)-alpha-methylbutyric acid. Both compounds were isolated from the hexane extracts of roots of Stevia pilosa Lag. together with four other longipinene derivatives. The developed correlation method is useful to ascertain the chirality of natural alpha-methylbutyryl esters found in nature and to reinforce the hypotheses on the biogenetic origin of these residues."}
