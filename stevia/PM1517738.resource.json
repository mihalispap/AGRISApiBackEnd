	"abstract":{"value":"A new acetylated ent-atisene glycoside, stevisalioside A [1], has been isolated as a bitter-tasting principle from Stevia salicifolia roots. The structure was established by the interpretation of spectral data, with the nmr assignments of this compound being based on 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C HETCOR, and selective INEPT experiments. A rearrangement product 4 of the aglycone moiety obtained by alkaline hydrolysis supported the structure of 1. This is the first report of the occurrence of an atisane-type diterpene from the genus Stevia."}
