	"abstract":{"value":"From the commercial extract of the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, two new minor diterpene glycosides having α-glucosyl linkage were isolated besides the known steviol glycosides including stevioside, steviolbioside, rebaudiosides A-F, rubusoside and dulcoside A. The structures of the two compounds were identified as 13-[(2-O-(3-α-O-d-glucopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (1), and 13-[(2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-(4-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (2), on the basis of extensive NMR and MS spectral data as well as chemical studies."}
