	"abstract":{"value":"It was found that a beta-fructofuranosidase produced by Microbacterium sp. H-1 has potent trans-beta-fructofuranosylation activity from sucrose (donor). By means of this enzyme system, rebaudioside A (RA), the second major sweet steviol glycoside of the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, was subjected to transfructosylation, affording a mono-beta-fructofuranosylated product (RA-F) in a high yield. The structure of RA-F was elucidated as beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2----6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester of steviol-13-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)]- [beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----3)]-beta-D-glucopyranoside. Some improvement in the quality of sweetness was observed for RA-F."}
