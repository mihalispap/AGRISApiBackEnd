		{"value":"Stevioside is a natural non-caloric sweetener isolated from Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaves. We have proposed its effect on attenuation of tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes. In this study, the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of stevioside and its metabolite, steviol, on human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) were evaluated."},
	{"value":"Stevioside and steviol, in the doses used in this study, had no cytotoxicity on Caco-2 cells. Anti-inflammatory activities of these two compounds were observed by potentially suppressed LPS-mediated TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 release. In addition, stevioside and steviol showed immunomodulatory effects on IκBα activation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) suppression in western blotting."},
