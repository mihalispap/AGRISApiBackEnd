	"abstract":{"value":"The effects of a hot water extract of the stem of Stevia rebaudiana on the smooth muscle of isolated guinea pig ileum were investigated. The butyl alcohol layer of the extract antagonized the contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum induced by histamine (1 x 10(-5) M) and acetylcholine (1 x 10(-5) M) in a concentration-dependent manner. The butyl alcohol layer of the extract also showed inhibition of CaCl(2) (1 x 10(-3)-3.8 x 10(-1) M)-induced contractions. The antagonism of the extract was considered to be non-specific, but this action might be related to an influx of extracellular Ca(2+). With column chromatography preparation, the active component was assumed to be as stevioside. The antagonistic effects exerted by the stem extract of Stevia rebaudiana contributed to the gastroprotective activity of the extract in animals fed dietary histamine."}
