	"abstract":{"value":"Complexation of known drugs with carbohydrate-containing plant metabolites is a promising way to synthesize new drugs that does not only save pharmacological properties of initial agent but also acquire a number of advantageous features such as increased water solubility, bioavailability and decreased toxicity. This review reports on the development and pharmacological evaluation of novel complexes of various well-known drugs with vegetable coplexation agents: glycyrrhizic acid, Stevia glycosides, gypsogenin tetraoside, pectin, xyloglucan, arabinogalactan. The aim of this review is to describe advantages of the new approach, suggested by authors, in the development of low toxic and high-performance drugs."}
