	"abstract":{"value":"A fermented aqueous extract from Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni showed strong bactericidal activity towards a wide range of food-borne pathogenic bacteria including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7. The colony-forming ability of the food-borne pathogenic bacteria tested so far was reduced to < 10(-7) when exposed to > or = 40% (v/v) solutions of the fermented extract at 37 C for 2 hr. Secretion of verocytotoxin 1 and 2 by enterohemorrhagic E. coli was also diminished by fermented extract at a concentration of > or = 10% (v/v). In contrast, the fermented extract did not significantly kill Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli. The active principle(s) of the fermented Stevia extract were bactericidal under acidic conditions."}
