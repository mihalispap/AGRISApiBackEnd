	"abstract":{"value":"Stevia rebaudiana extracts and plant materials are increasingly used as natural sweeteners. Polyphenolic and stevioside compounds contained in S. rebaudiana extracts were separated by comprehensive LC. A polyamine column operated in normal phase mode was used for the first dimension separation (D1), and a UHPLC C18 column operated in reversed phase mode was used for the second dimension separation (D2). The sub-2 μm column (2.1 mm × 30 mm, maintained at 70°C) and the UHPLC pump employed for D2 elution allowed a separation/cycle time of 20 s, with a backpressure oscillating between 805 and 922 bar at 3.4 mL/min. The reduced D2 cycle time allowed 3-12 D2 samplings for each peak eluted by D1. Polyphenolic and stevioside compounds were identified by combining the information coming from the position of the compounds in the 2D plot and UV spectra with that of reference materials."}
