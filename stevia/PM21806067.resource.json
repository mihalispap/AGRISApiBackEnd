	"abstract":{"value":"Stevia rebaudiana leaves are used as a zero-calorie natural sweetener in a variety of food products in Asian countries, especially in Japan. In this study, the hydroxycinnamate derivatives of S. rebaudiana have been investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by LC-MSn. Twenty-four hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of quinic and shikimic acid were detected, and 19 of them were successfully characterized to regioisomeric levels; 23 are reported for the first time from this source. These comprise three monocaffeoylquinic acids (Mr 354), seven dicaffeoylquinic acids (Mr 516), one p-coumaroylquinic acid (Mr 338), one feruloylquinic acid (Mr 368), two caffeoyl-feruloylquinic acids (Mr 530), three caffeoylshikimic acids (Mr 336), and two tricaffeoylquinic acids (Mr 678). Cis isomers of di- and tricaffeoylquinic acids were observed as well. Three tricaffeoylquinic acids identified in stevia leaves are reported for the first time in nature. These phenolic compounds identified in stevia might affect the organoleptic properties and add additional beneficial health effects to stevia-based products."}
