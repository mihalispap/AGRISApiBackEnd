	"abstract":{"value":"The aim of this study was to elucidate the presence of vitamin E homologues in medicinal plants. To identify various homologues in the matrix of medicinal plant samples, a method for simultaneous determination was developed using ESI(+)-LC-MS3. A complete separation of each homologue was achieved within 20 min using a PFP column and an isocratic elution system of water/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The ESI-MS condition for each homologue was optimized, and the m/z value and the fragmentation pathway of each homologue were summarized. This LC-MS3 method made it possible to detect the homologues without the effect of matrix; therefore, high sensitive analysis was established, and then, the MS3 makes it possible to extract from plants with methanol only. The LC-MS3 method was applied to identify the eight vitamin E homologues in 11 medicinal plants."}
