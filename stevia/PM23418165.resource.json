	"abstract":{"value":"Seventeen steviol derivatives, i.e., 2-18, and 19 isosteviol derivatives, i.e., 19-37, were prepared from a diterpenoid glycoside, stevioside (1). Upon evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of these compounds against leukemia (HL60), lung (A549), stomach (AZ521), and breast (SK-BR-3) cancer cell lines, nine steviol derivatives, i.e., 5-9 and 11-14, and five isosteviol derivatives, i.e., 28-32, exhibited activities with single-digit micromolar IC(50) values against one or more cell lines. All of these active compounds possess C(19)-O-acyl group, and among which, ent-kaur-16-ene-13,19-diol 19-O-4',4',4'-trifluorocrotonate (14) exhibited potent cytotoxicities against four cell lines with IC(50) values in the range of 1.2-4.1 Î¼M. Compound 14 induced typical apoptotic cell death in HL60 cells upon evaluation of the apoptosis-inducing activity by flow-cytometric analysis. These results suggested that acylation of the 19-OH group of kaurane- and beyerane-type diterpenoids might be useful for enhancement of their cytotoxicities with apoptosis-inducing activity."}
