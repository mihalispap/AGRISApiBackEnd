	"abstract":{"value":"The effects of steviol, obtained from Stevia rebaudiana, on renal function were investigated using clearance techniques in Wistar rats. Steviol (0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg(-1)/h(-1)iv) elicited no significant changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal effective plasma flow (ERPF). The steviol infusion (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg(-1)/h(-1)), however, induced a significant increase in the fractional sodium excretion (FeNa(+)), fractional potassium excretion (FeK(+)), and urinary flow as percent of glomerular filtration rate (V/GFR) when compared to controls. The data suggest that the steviol may affect salt and water transport in renal tubules."}
