	"abstract":{"value":"The effects of administration of Stevia rebaudiana extracts for 20, 40 and 60 days on renal function and mean arterial pressure in normal Wistar rats were evaluated. Results showed that the Stevia rebaudiana treated rats group for 20 days did not significantly differ from the control group. Chronic administration of a crude extract for 40 and 60 days induced hypotension, diuresis and natriuresis with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) constant. An increase of the renal plasma flow (RPF) was exclusively observed for the group treated for 60 days. The results suggests that oral administration to rats of an aqueous extract of Stevia dried leaves induce systemic and renal vasodilation, causing hypotension, diuresis and natriuresis."}
