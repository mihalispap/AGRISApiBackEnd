	"abstract":{"value":"New derivatives of steviol 1, the aglycone of the glycosides of Stevia rebaudiana, including a novel class of semisynthetic diterpenoids, namely macrocyclic ent-kauranes were synthesized. These compounds possess antituberculosis activity inhibiting the in vitro growth of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (H37R(V) strain) with MIC 5-20 μg/ml that is close to MIC 1 μg/ml demonstrated by antituberculosis drug isoniazid in control experiment. For the first time it was found that the change of ent-kaurane geometry (as in steviol 1) of tetracyclic diterpenoid skeleton to ent-beyerane one (as in isosteviol 2) influences on antituberculosis activity."}
