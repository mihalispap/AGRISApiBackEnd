	"abstract":{"value":"A micropropagation method for STEVIA REBAUDIANA plants was established by culturing young leaves of adult plants on medium containing 6-benzyladenine (BA) (2.0 mg/l) in the light or BA (2.0 mg/l) plus 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (2.0 mg/l) in the dark. An open-ended system was obtained by transfer of the regenerating material to medium containing BA (0.1 mg/l), with continuous subculture and isolation of suitable shoots. Auxin addition to the rooting medium (especially at 0.1 mg/l 3-indolebutyric acid - IBA) favored root formation and improved EXTRA VITRUM plant survival. Regenerated plants transferred to the soil were uniform and cytological observation in root tip cells showed normal chromosome number (2n = 22). Cultures treated with colchicine originated altered plants."}
