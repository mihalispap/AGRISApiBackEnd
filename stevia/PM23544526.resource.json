	"abstract":{"value":"Cell wall polysaccharides from leaves of Stevia rebaudiana were extracted successively with water and with aq. 10% KOH. After the purification steps, homogeneous fractions (SFW-10RM and SSFK-10RM) were analyzed by sugar composition, HPSEC, methylation and (13)C NMR spectroscopy analysis. The results showed that SFW-10RM is a pectic arabinogalactan with an unusual β-(1→6)-linked D-Galp residues forming the main chain. Approximately 38% of the β-D-Galp units of the backbone carry branches on position O-3, consisting of single D-Galp units or arabinan side chains. Arabinose residues were found to occupy mostly the terminal positions in both furanose and pyranose forms and as 2-, 5- and 3,5-linked residues in these side chains. Fraction SSFK-10RM is a similar arabinogalactan, differing mainly in the relative proportions of arabinans attached to the galactan core and in the content of D-GalpA residues present in the pectic domain. The crude aqueous and alkaline extracts and homogeneous SSFK-10RM showed antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex Virus type-1 (HSV-1) in vitro."}
