	"abstract":{"value":"Nonpolar and medium polarity fractions from whole plant methanolic extracts of Stevia monardifolia afforded the new 7beta-angeloyloxy-8alpha-isovaleroyloxylongipin-2-en-1-one 1 along with known 7beta,8alpha-diangeloyloxylongipin-2-en-1-one 2 and 7beta,8alpha-diangeloyloxylongipinan-1-one 3. Alkaline hydrolysis of a mixture of 1 and 2 gave 7beta,8alpha-dihydroxylongipin-2-en-lone 4 which was subjected to a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The new compound 1, which is the third 7beta,8alpha-dihydroxylongipin-2-en-1-one diester natural product isolated from a Stevia especies, was fully characterized by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and its absolute configuration was confirmed as the 4R,5S,7S,8S,10R,11R enantiomer by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) measurements in comparison to calculation at the B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory."}
