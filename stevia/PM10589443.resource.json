	"abstract":{"value":"To evaluate the effect of crude extract of Stevia rebaudiana on renal water, Na+ and K+ excretion, male Wistar rats (250-350 g each) under antidiuresis or water diuresis conditions, were evaluated. During intravenous infusion of the extract (0.05 mg/min/100 g) no significant differences were detected in mean arterial pressure or renal hemodynamics parameters. In contrast, fractional water and sodium excretion and solute clearance increased significantly, in both groups of animals. In antidiuresis rats the extract significantly increased reabsorption of water by the collecting duct and in water diuresis animals the extract significantly increased free water clearance. The data suggest preferential action of the extract in the proximal tubular cells involved with salt transport mechanism."}
