		{"value":"The researches of studying the cobalt maintenance in various types of arable soils of Belarus are conducted. Low security of micronutrient mobile form in republic soils is established. The major factors defining the maintenance of mobile cobalt in soil are revealed. Sod-podzolic soils of Belarus are poorly provided with mobile forms of cobalt. The lowest cobalt content was typical for sod-podzolic sandy (0.25 mg / kg) and sandy loam (0.39 mg / kg) soils, the highest – for sod-podzolic soil developing a powerful morainic loam (1.09 mg / kg). In sod-calcareous soil, which is among the most fertile in the territory of the Republic of Belarus, mobile cobalt content is 0.90 mg / kg, which, under existing gradations, characterizes them as low containing mobile cobalt (less than 1.0 mg / kg). Very low cobalt content was marked for peat soils - 0,38-0,73 mg / kg (according to gradations, to include low supply of peat soil containing mobile cobalt less than 3.0 mg / kg).",
