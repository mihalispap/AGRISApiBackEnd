		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied breeding of green foxtail (Setaria italica) samples and the analysis of the range of their variability in the competitive variety testing. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in selection crop rotation of Scientific and Practical Center for Arable Farming of NAN of Belarus in 2007-2011 on sod-podzolic, light loamy, moderately cultivated, moderately podzolic soil, moderately provided with mobile forms of phosphorous and exchange potassium with content of humus 2.0-2.1%. The explanation of the population formation with higher bottom yield level in unfavorable years compared with the tendency to the maximum yield in favorable years was given. As a result of realized research it was revealed that green foxtail had rather long vegetative period, in separate years till 136 days. It occurs owing to increase in duration of the ear emergence period. Therefore green foxtail in Belarus consider first of all as fodder culture. Studying of an initial material green foxtail was necessary for accompanying an estimation of crop yield variability scope. At the initial stages of selection process on grain efficiency it was necessary to be guided by level of the bottom limit of crop yield in adverse year. It would make it possible to receive annually grain green foxtail in the Republic of Belarus in spite of the fact that it was northern border of cultivation of the given culture.",
