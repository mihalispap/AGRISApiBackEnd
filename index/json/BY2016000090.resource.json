		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were considered processes of consecutive transformation of various forms of managing on the village. Besides, ways of transition of agricultural production from the small-scale shattered country enterprise to large are investigated. These processes are studied at various historical stages of formation and development of an agrarian policy of Belarus - from the pre-revolutionary period, before creation of modern large-scale commodity production of industrial level. Changes in the agroindustrial sphere are studied in all variety of forms of managing on the earth, within forms of ownership, characteristic for the modern Belarusian village. Carried out research on ordering knowledge of the contents and specificity of agrarian reforms at various historical stages of society development allows defining, that the modern agrarian policy of the Belarus state has inherited all merits and demerits of the previous agrarian transformations in their discrepancy and continuity. Advantages that peasantry as the social group has been kept contrary to all negative circumstances owing to what large-scale modernization of the agriculture has been carried out, allowed to provide food safety of the country. The main thing from lacks was their imperfection inherited from the previous reforms, formal character, they did not consider interests of peasantry as special social group, did not promote change of conditions of managing, strengthening of manufacturers work motivation and real legal security of agricultural population before the person of the bureaucratic device.",
