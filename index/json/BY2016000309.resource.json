		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the spatial distribution of mineral nitrogen, mobile phosphorus and potassium forms in agricultural lands adjacent to animal complexes. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus on agrarian soils of Nesvizh district in Minsk region in 2011-2012. As a result of realized soil-environmental research it was revealed that the main soil pollutants of agricultural lands were mobile phosphorus and potassium forms, which were found in high content than the optimal values in soils. It was found that soils, which were situated in the affected zone of animal complexes, with increased content of mobile phosphorus occupied 58-60% of the investigated lands area, with a very high and high content of mobile potassium - 58-84%, with a very low-and low content of mineral nitrogen - 70-82%. Results 2011-2012 route research showed that in the zone of influence of cattle-breeding complex for cattle fattening a percent of soils with very high ( 400 mg / kg) and high (151-250 mg / kg) content of available phosphorus increased, respectively, by 3.2% and 13.8% compared with the data of 10 rounds agrochemical land survey in 2007-2008, in the zone of pig farm influence the percent of soils with very high ( 400 mg/kg) and high (251-400 mg/kg) content of mobile phosphorus - by 2.9% and 1.4%. The share of soil near the breeding complex for cattle fattening with very high ( 400 mg / kg) content of mobile potassium increased by 28.6% compared to the 10 round, with low (81-140 mg/kg), medium (141-200 mg/kg), high (201-300 mg/kg) and high (301-400 mg/kg) decreased by 2.6%, 4.4%, 6.6% and 19.0% respectively. Near the pig farm amount of soil with a very high content of K2O ( 400 mg/kg) increased by 3.4%, and low (81-140 mg kg), high (201-300 mg kg) and very high ( 400 mg/kg) - decreased by 1.8-3.1% compared with 10 round.",
