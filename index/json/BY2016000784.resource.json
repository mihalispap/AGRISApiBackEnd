		{"value":"In course of the research there were considered major factors of production in agriculture: land, work, capital. On the basis of the analysis which was spent with use of production function of Kobba-Douglas the scale effect of production in the context of agricultural branches was appreciated, sizes of limiting productivity and a limit rate of replacement of land, work and capital were revealed. The received results made it possible to estimate efficiency of use of resources in the context of branches of the agricultural enterprises and to judge expediency of investment directions. Using the results of this analysis could be seen as areas of investment in various sectors, and the feasibility of resource transfer in each branch of the agricultural enterprise. Regularities of replacement and additional production resources made it possible to find ways of the most efficient use of material costs, labor costs and land (livestock) in the specific conditions of agriculture, and could also be taken in predicting the rational combination of participating in the process of production resources.",
