		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented research into inheritance of quantitative features by F1 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) hybrids was studied. It was established that the inheritance of productivity elements was by the type of overdominance. Analysis of the inheritance of the first-generation hybrids showed that the inheritance of elements productivity by overdominance type (length of main head - 69.2% of the hybrids, the number of grains in the main head - 63.5%, with the main mass of grain ear - 73.1%, weight grain plants - 71.2% hybrids), and plant height marked depression trait in 51.7% of samples.The highest inheritance of the analyzed features was in the hybrid combinations, in which the following varieties of Belarusian breeding were used as parent forms: Schara (length of the main ear, Hp = 67% and the number of kernels in the main ear, Hp = 38%), Kapylyanka (grain weight per main ear, Hp = 38%) and Uzliot (grain weight per plant, Hp = 63.6%). By the complex of agronomic characters none of the hybrids was isolated.",
