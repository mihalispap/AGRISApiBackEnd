		{"value":"In course of the research there were considered the modern problems of development of small and medium agribusiness: high level of taxes, lack of mechanisms of distribution of means, inefficiency forms of the budgetary support and others. As a result of realized research the resolution of problems of state regulation and support of small and average agro- business of the Republic of Belarus through improvement of the taxation, subsidizing, creation of state programs of regulation was proposed. It was concluded that small and medium agribusiness in Belarus is under development. The development of the whole Belarus depends on its operation, the ratio of state and society in this area of the economy. For more effective development of small and medium agribusiness in the current economic conditions it is necessary to change the attitude of government to business entities - an important source of long-term economic growth in Belarus. A harmoniously formed mechanism of state regulation and financial support is able to withstand extreme external economic and political factors, market, international competition and other factors.",
