		{"value":"The effectiveness of insemination of Holstein heifers with sexed semen has been determined and the causes of decline in their reproductive ability have been revealed. It has been established that an important reason for the decline in reproductive abil-ity of Holstein cow-heifers is a too high gain in the live weight at the breeding age (6‒12 months) and the decrease in growth during the breeding time. It noticeably postpones the date of their first insemination and the first calving (up to 2.5 months), which contrib-utes to a high frequency of postpartum disorders. After calving 95.7 % of the animals had inflammatory processes of various severity in reproductive organs, although the frequency of retained placenta was only 7.8 %. Adverse post-partum period, despite the quali-fied treatment, made the completion of the involution of uterus as well as the resumption of sexual cycles longer and was one of the main reasons for cow disposal. Insemination of Holstein heifers with sexed semen allows you to get in the offspring 91.5 percent of female calves (in the control – 61.7 %).",
