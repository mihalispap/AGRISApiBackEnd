		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the influence of methods of forming ridges on the yield and quality of early white cabbage (Brassica oleracea convar. capitata var. alba L.). The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in 2010-2011 on trial field of the Institute of Vegetable Growing (Minsk region). As a result of realized research it was found that the best growth and development of plants was provided in the seed-plots formed by active and passive working bodies. Yield increase towards cabbage growing on a flat surface and soil was 2.3-7.9 and 5.0-9.7 m/ha, respectively, in a dose of fertilizer. It was revealed that for ultra-early ripening hybrid Ilariya F1 optimal in terms of plant cover spunbond (unwoven agromaterial) was application of 60 t/ha in combination with TNK N90P85K135, which together with the cultivation on the seed-plots formed by the active working members, to provide the productivity of 57.3 t/ha, in forming of seed-plots by passive working bodies - 54.5 t/ha for growing cabbage on a flat surface of the field - 47.6 t/ha. Further increase of the dose of fertilizer to the level N115P106K168 did not increase the yield of cabbage. It was found that different methods of forming of seed-plots did not cause appreciable differences in the chemical composition of cabbages which largely depended on the season and the weather conditions and applied doses of complex fertilizers.",
