		{"value":"In course of the research there was realized a comparative estimation of features of growth, development and efficiency of the new released and perspective varieties of medicinal valerian (Valeriana officinalis) of domestic and foreign selection in soil-climatic conditions of the Republic of Belarus.  As a result of realized research it was revealed that the most considerable increase of general medicinal valerian biomass was marked in the following period: from the phase of 10-12 real leaves to stopping of vegetation (August-October). More active forming of general valerian biomass was set for the variety of Anastasia which, by the end of vegetation, formed general biomass of 67.5 c/ha. The highest rates of forming of leaf biomass were set in the following period: from the phase of 5-6 to 10-13 real leaves (the third ten-day period of July - the third ten-day period of August). After the phase of 10-12 leaves (from the third ten-day period of August to stopping of vegetation in the second-third ten-day periods of October), rates of accumulation of biomass of roots and rhizomes of valerian notably grew, that confirmed by the decline of the index of correlation of leaf biomass to underground biomass from 0.74-0.78 to 0.64-0.67. The most intensive forming of leaf area was set for the variety of Anastasia which had the maximum values of leaf area index (4.40).",
