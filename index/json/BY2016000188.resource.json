		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented the results of studies different schemes of selecting potato clones is intended for health improvement by biotechnological methods. Is was shown that the selection of clones to update the collection of potato varieties using ELISA and PCR in combination with indexation made it possible to identify a healthy parental material for the subsequent introduction of in vitro culture and micropropagation. It was found that all three schemes for the selection of clones for obtaining initial breeding material of different varieties of potatoes, free from plant pathogens using ELISA and PCR in combination with indexing allowed to select a healthy source material for subsequent administration to in vitro culture and micropropagation. Studies have shown that the application of improved scheme made it possible to select the healthy material before the introduction of in vitro culture and get away from labor-intensive, long-term process that is associated with the release of explants. The entire cycle of selection of clones with integrated diagnostics, including indexing, ELISA, PCR, before administration the healthy clones in culture in vitro, takes nine to ten months, instead of 2 years used in the previous scheme.",
