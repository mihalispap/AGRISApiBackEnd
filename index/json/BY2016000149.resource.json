		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented research results on the study of the effect of nitrogen fertilizers on the formation of leaf surface, nutrient removal and economic efficiency of cruciferous crops in afterharvest sowings. Objects of the investigation were non erucic, low-glucosinolative included into the State Register cultivars of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) of Leader variety, spring rape of Yawar variety, winter wild turnip (Brassica campestris L.) of Veronica variety. Also in the experiment there was used oil radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleifera) of Nick cultivar as one of the most productive crop. As a result of the realized studies it was found that the formation of productivity indicators of cruciferous crops such as leaf area and photosynthetic potential depended greatly on the level of nitrogen nutrition and the number of days of vegetation. Maximum leaf area in all studied crops was achieved with application of  N120 and PKN20: in 65 days of vegetation it was, respectively, for spring rape 49.2 and 47.4 thousand m2 / ha, for winter rape -50,2-54,7, for winter wild turnip - 48,1-50,2 and oil radish - 52.3 and 51.6 thousand m2 / ha, resulting in a corresponding increase in the values of photosynthetic potential. The correlation coefficient between the photosynthetic potential and dry matter yield was 0.95.",
