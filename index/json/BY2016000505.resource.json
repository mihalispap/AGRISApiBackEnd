		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented results of researches on the monitoring of the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) in maize (Zea mays) seedlings. According to the researches three new outbreaks of the pest in the Brest region are identified. Based on agro-climatic conditions of the republic and ecological features of the spread of the pest phytophage in Belarus is forecasted. As a result of the realized pheromonitoringof western corn rootworm, the dangerous quarantine pest, in Belarus there were identified three focal points of the secondary infestation of the pest. Initial infestation with corn rootworm occurred in the Brest region of Belarus as a result of expansion of main focal point (Poland). The households, where the pest was found, were placed under quarantine and isolated some adjustable zones, each of which there were carried mandatory (quarantine, agronomic and chemical) activities. Total for the season there were captured 89 adult corn rootworms. In maize seedlings there were held insecticide treatment with insecticide Agrolan, at a rate of 0.06 kg / ha. Biological effectiveness of the realized measures on day 3 after treatment was 100%.",
