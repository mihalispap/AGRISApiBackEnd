		{"value":"Regional economic complex as a system of economic relations is methodologically examined; the functional subsystem of a single economic complex of the country is researched. The results of a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the economic complex of the Grodno region are shown; the conceptual ways of the improving of formation and development of regional economic complex (on the example of Grodno region) in market conditions are outlined. The definition of priority sectors of the industrial complex in the region is given; the most important ways to enhance international relations of regional economic complex are proposed. Theoretical basis of the analysis of regional economic complex as well as main directions of development of regional economic theory is substantiated; theories of comparative analysis of the regional economy in foreign studies are evaluated. The nature, content and evolution of the concept and mechanism of formation of regional economic complex are analyzed. Evaluation of the status of regional commercial complex (on the example of Grodno region) is made, the most important problems are outlined, and place and role of the economic complex of the Grodno region in the national economy of the Republic of Belarus are analyzed. Comparative assessment of the economic centers of the regions of the Republic of Belarus is presented. The most important directions of improvement of the formation and development of economic sector of the Grodno region are noticed; the main ways of the development of the city and the region in terms of market relations are suggested.",
