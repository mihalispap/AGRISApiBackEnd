		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the coenotic activity of various varieties of white clover (Trifolium repens) and perennial ryegrass varieties in multicomponent pasture mixtures. The field experiment was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus on sod-podzolic related-sandy loam soil in 2011. As a result of realized research it was revealed that use of white clover in cereal grass mixtures provided additional accumulation of plant biomass up to 177 c per 1 ha for a pasture season. Ontogenetic tempo of festulolium yield formation was characterized by asynchrony with growth rate processes of perennial ryegrass, due to that, both of those species were well combined in one pasture grass mixture. The best mix of species of perennial grasses in the pasture mixtures observed in perennial ryegrass and white clover, which have different rhythms of growth, using the optimal conditions of life at different periods of the growing season and provide for joint cultivation of the greatest accumulation of biomass.",
