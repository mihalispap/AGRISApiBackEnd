	"abstract":{"value":"A study conducted on rats using classical clearance techniques and arterial pressure measurements showed that stevioside from Stevia rebaudiana leaves produced a fall in systemic blood pressure, as well as diuresis and natriuresis per milliliter of glomerular filtration rate. Verapamil tended to increase the renal and systemic effects of stevioside. In contrast, an infusion of CaCl2 in rats prepared with stevioside induced a marked attenuation of the vasodilating responses of stevioside. These data are consistent with the possibility that stevioside may act as a calcium antagonist, as is the case for verapamil."}
