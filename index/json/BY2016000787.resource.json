		{"value":"In course of the research there were examined the main export agricultural commodities and food of the Republic of Belarus to the Republic of Kazakhstan, with emphasis on the analysis of exports from the region. As a result of realized research it was revealed the structure of exports of agricultural production regions of the Republic of Belarus to the Republic of Kazakhstan. The calculation for the medium term perspective of agricultural exports to the Republic of Kazakhstan was made. Kazakhstan is one of the main trade partners of the CIS countries, ranking second place after the Russian Federation by procurement of Belarusian agricultural and processed products. In 2011 it was implemented to Kazakhstan of agricultural raw materials and food for 160 473 million $US (an increase of 2010 -37.1%). It was formed import dependence of Kazakhstan for many types of processed products of agribusiness. Thus, it is the high level of import dependence on fruits and vegetables, processed products of meat and milk. For food security in Kazakhstan Belarus suggested to include in the industrialization map a Belarusian package - seed production, milk production, processing of agricultural products, etc.",
