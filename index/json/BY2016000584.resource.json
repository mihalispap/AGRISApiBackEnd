		{"value":"The paper deals with a comparative assessment of fattening, slaughter and meat qualities of the Belarusian meat pigs, as well as the Duroc breed of Belarusian and Canadian selection. It has been established that pigs of the Belarusian meat breed have the best fattening qualities. Young pigs were characterized by a higher growth rate - 754 g, which is 25 g, or of 3.84 % more than that of the Duroc young pigs of Belarusian selection and 79 g, or 11.7 % more than that of the young Duroc of Canadian selection. The young Duroc pigs of Canadian selection had better meat qualities when compared with their herdmates of Belarusian meat breed, as well as the Duroc breed of Belarusian selection. Pigs of Canadian type had the largest eye-muscle area (44.2 cm2) and thinner backfat (18.2 mm). Pigs of the Belarusian meat breed had greater slaughter yield in comparison with the Du-roc analogues of Belarusian selection, however, the latter had a larger eye-muscle area and thinner backfat",
