		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the technique of economic assessment of current state of investment activity of linen sub-complex and justification of priorities of investment resources formation include methods of the dynamic analysis of investment activity on the basis of updating of regulatory base of investment resources use by means of the econometric models developed for the enterprises of uniform group taking into account perspective tendencies of return on investment. The organizational and economic model of attraction of investments into formation of current assets of the flax-sowing enterprises of the linen sub-complex, differing from basic by use of econometric dependence of effective use of investments into inventory holdings of a linen sub-complex was given within spline-groups. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research it was revealed that for improving of the return on investments in the production of flax products should pay more attention to the selection of varieties adapted to the characteristics of the soils of this region. However, the main growth factors of return on investments in flax production were the level and nature of motivation.",
