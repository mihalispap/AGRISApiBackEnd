		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there was presented an analytical method of research into the movement of drop of absorbent liquid from the surface of wave-like disc disperser, installed in the mixing chamber of granulator. There was obtained the system of differential equations, which helps to determine the trajectory of movement of drop during its breakaway from the surface of disperser of the suggested construction. Construction of this system helps to connect constructive parameters of elements of granulator mixing chamber and regimes of work of the given disperser. Results of research will be used for the planning of experimental research into the process of enveloping of seed material with liquid and viscous components, as well as for the calculation of devices of the suggested construction. As a result of the study there was obtained the system of the differential equations, allowing to model drop movement at its separation from a surface of a wavy disk spray. This made it possible to connect design data of elements of the camera of mixing of panner with operating modes of a spray of a considered design.",
