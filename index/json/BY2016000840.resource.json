		{"value":"The meat raw material intended for products of a children's feed, has been received from the animals which have been grown up without application of growth factors, hormonal preparations, fodder antibiotics, synthetic nitrogen contented substances, products of microbic synthesis, that were observed all necessary conditions of reception of ecologically clean meat raw material. 4 groups of newborns calves have been selected for experience. In skilled groups have been included on 10 heads thoroughbred calves of Limouzin breeds (II group) and hybrids: Limousine х black-motley (III group) and limousine х Men-anzhu (IV group) which were grown up on suckling under cows-mothers up to 5,5-6-monthes age. The contempoparies of the black-motley breed who have been grown up on traditional technology of dairy cattle breeding have been used as control group (I group). Studies have shown a higher nutritional value of the raw meat obtained from 6-month-old calves of Limousin breed and its hybrids compared with their coevals of black-motley breed on the content of vitamin B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), E (tocopherol), PP (niacin) and A (retinol). In boiled sausages the content of vitamins compared to the starting material is somewhat reduced. However, the use of meat obtained from 6-month-old crossbred calves of Limousine breed and its hybrids for preparation ofboiled sausage products allows to raise the vitamins level (A – 1,5-9,5 times, E – by 15-22.5% and more , PP – by 8,6-13,9% B1 – by 26,2-35,7 %, B2 – by 14,3-19,0%)",
