		{"value":"In course of the research there was analyzed total and specific combining ability by protein content and main agronomic characters using the method of complete diallel crossings. As a result of realized research the most promising varieties for barley (Hordeum vulgare), breeding for malting qualities, were determined. Variety Ksanadu, having high authentic negative degree of the general combinational ability under the protein content in grain, was characterized also by high authentic positive general combinational ability by quantity of productive stalks and negative - on height of plants, quantity of grains from the main ear and mass of 1000 grains. As a result it was possible to assume, that use of the given genotype in barley selection on brewing qualities will lead with a high probability to reception low albuminous, short stalk hybrids with high productive bushiness. The variety Taler along with low positive degree of the general combinational ability under the protein content in grain was characterized by negative general combinational ability on height of plants, high authentic positive - by quantity of grains from the main ear and positive - by quantity of productive stalks. It was possible to assume, that use of the given variety in barley selection on brewing qualities would not promote increase in the content of protein in grain of hybrids and heights of plants, would not reduce quantity of productive stalks, but will essentially increase quantity of grains in the main ear.",
