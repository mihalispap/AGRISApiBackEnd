		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented the results of 2009-2012 studies of an influence of various methods of a crown formation on indicators of pear tree (Pyrus L.) productivity. As a result of the researches made in the orchard planted in 2005 there was revealed a cultivar reaction on various methods of a pear tree crown formation. The yield at the hybrid 90-39/80 ('Zaveya') and at the cultivar 'Prosto Mariya' was higher at the crown formation by shoots pruning and shortening (the control). At the control variant there were gotten 29,1 tons per hectare of the fruits of the hybrid 90-39/80 ('Zaveya') and the cultivar 'Prosto Mariya' produced 76,8 tons per hectare of the fruits. The cultivar 'Kudesnitsa' appeared to be more productive at the crown formation by means of shoots pruning. At this variant of formation for the last 4 years there have been received 48,2 tons per hectare of fruits. The average fruit weight was higher in comparison with the control at the crown formation by the method of shoots pruning. In 2011 at the hybrid 90-39/80 ('Zaveya') the average weight of a fruit was higher by 23 grams at the crown formation by shoots pruning and shortening. The fruits of the cultivar 'Kudesnitsa' are larger at the variant of the crown formation by shoots pruning and shortening. The average fruit weight makes 178 grams and 163 grams at the crown formation by shoots pruning.",
