	"abstract":{"value":"Cookies high in proteins and low in calories were prepared by substituting wheat maida with defatted soy flour (DSF) at 0, 10, 15, 20 and 25% levels and sugar with stevia leaves powder (SLP) at 0, 15, 20, 25 and 30% levels using traditional creamery method. Cookies were evaluated for physico-chemical and sensory quality parameters. The thickness and hardness of cookies increased; weight, diameter, spread ratio and spread factor decreased with increasing levels of DSF while there was increase in protein, crude fiber and ash content and decrease in fat and carbohydrate contents. The cookies with 20% substitution each of DSF and SLP scored maximum for all the sensory quality attributes. On storage of such cookies in LDPE, HDPE and PP for 90Â days at ambient temperature, the sensory quality attributes were decreased, but the cookies were acceptable. The HDPE was better packaging material than LDPE and PP with regard to sensory quality of cookies during storage."}
