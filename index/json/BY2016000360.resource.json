		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied yield and yield elements of new spring soft wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties (Laska, Lubava, Sudarynya) depending on nitrogen level and weather conditions during the growing season. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in 2011-2012 on sod-podzolic loamy light loamy good cultivated soil in field plots of the Scientific and Practical Center for Arable Farming. As a result of realized research it was revealed that cv. Laska increased grain yield in comparison with the standard cultivar (cv. Rassvet) by 6.9-7.6 c per 1 ha, it had good reaction to nitrogen fertilizers and provided yield increase due to increasing of ear productivity. Cultivar Laska provided yield increase is mainly due to a larger number of grains per ear, and Sudarynya - by increasing the mass of 1000 grains. Biometrics of varieties of spring wheat at various levels of nitrogen nutrition (average for 2011-2012) was presented. Crop yield of spring wheat grain according to variety and nitrogen rates, yield structure elements of spring wheat varieties at various levels of nitrogen nutrition (average for 2011-2012) were shown.",
