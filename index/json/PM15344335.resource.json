	"abstract":{"value":"Fluo-3/AM, a calcium indicator, was introduced by low temprature loading method into callus protoplasts of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni. The microscope observation results showed that NaCl in different concentrations (30-200mmol/L) can elevate the intracellular calcium concentration in protoplasts. The elevation was related to the amount of salinity. The effect of salinity stress was inhibited by LiCl pretreatment but restored by inositol pretreatment. This suggested that salinity stress promoted the cytoplasmic calcium activity, perhaps by activating the phosphoinoditide system. As a result of salinity stress signals, elevated calcium activity may trigger corresponding metabolic changes, such as synthesis of enzyme via activating other members of calcium signal system, fit the cells for the change of the environment."}
