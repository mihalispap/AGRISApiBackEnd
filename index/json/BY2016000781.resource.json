		{"value":"In course of the research there were differentiated the indicators of economic, technical and techno-economic efficiency. As the main from indicators of economic efficiency profitability level on additional charge and profit, technical and economic in agriculture - additional charge and profit level were distinguished. The profitability of sales does not belong to efficiency indicators. There were indicators in which additional charge and limit value was used in system of efficiency indicators. Thus, economic efficiency is the ratio of the production result, expressed in monetary terms, the means to achieve it, in terms of money. As the main among indicators of economic efficiency are the level of profitability in the added value and profit feasibility in agriculture - the level of added value and profit. Added value takes precedence over profit. Profit is its part and the result of value added distribution. Profits can be used without distorting the real situation, provided that wages and tax system unchanged. Return on sales is not a measure of performance. The system performance is important to use as the effects (results), the added cost, as well as indicators of the components - the limit values.",
