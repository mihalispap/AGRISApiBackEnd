		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented data on the importance of nanotechnology, the possibility of their use in the field of agriculture with manufacturing and processing of agricultural products, as well as problems associated with their implementation. Nanotechnology promises to become the central innovative engine and the engine of development. Therefore for the future of the Belarus agrarian and industrial complex the question of an innovative susceptibility, including and to nanotechnologies is actual. On results of carried out research following offers are formulated: to define group of Belarus scientific research institutes and educational universities which have scientific potential for carrying out of researches in the field of use nanotechnologies in AIC system; to define some basic (no more than 3-4) directions in plant growing and animal industries on development of nanotechnologies use; to provide in structure of the budget allocated for basic researches on nanotechnologies use, expenses for the equipment, a payment, materials and other charges under expenses clauses.",
