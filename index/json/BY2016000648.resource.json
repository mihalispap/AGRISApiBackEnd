		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the primary root system growth of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) varietal populations at +10 deg C depending on ploidy level and plant morphotype. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research significant differences in growth intensity of the primary root between diploid and tetraploid cultivars was revealed. Plant morphotype had less impact on their resistance in cold stress conditions but for diploid varieties, determinate populations were differed by more intensive growth at +10 deg C, compared with indeterminate ones, while for tetraploid varieties, the indeterminate morphotype had clear advantages of the growth of primary root system. To spend an estimation of grades гречихи on stability to cold stress for the subsequent selection on cold constancy at use of the lowered positive temperature +10 deg C it was necessary for 12th day when it was possible to define degree of intensity of development of a primary root at seed germination without dependence from ploidy level and a plant morphotype.",
