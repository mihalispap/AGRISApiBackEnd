		{"value":"The monograph represents general review of Belarusian forests, analyzes their ecological and structural status. Habitat conditions of forest communities, influence of climatic factors on the forest vegetation, soil conditions of Belarusian forests, air and water properties of soils, water-and-air regime of soils are researched. Dependence of productivity of pine and spruce stands on the texture of the soil is analyzed; dependence of productivity of pine and spruce stands on the depth of groundwater water is evaluated. Concretization of habitat conditions of forest plant communities in Belarus is made; classification of forest soils is suggested. Chemical properties of forest soils (soil acidity, seasonal and spatial variation of soil acidity, exchange acidity of the soil in the pine and spruce plantations, influence of the species composition of plants on exchangeable acidity of the soils) are enumerated. Spatial variation of the content of available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium in soils of pine plantations is analyzed; content of available phosphorus in soils of spruce stands, content of exchangeable potassium in soils of spruce stands is researched. Vegetation classification of the forests of the Republic of Belarus is presented; ecological and floristic classification of pine forests, pine forests on the distribution of space groups is suggested. Valuation of forest stands and forest soils is made; practical use of forest stands and soils is offered. Reforestation and planting of new trees along with basic types of forest plantations in Belarus is described. Anthropogenic changes of forest ecosystems and measures to improve soil fertility are suggested.",
