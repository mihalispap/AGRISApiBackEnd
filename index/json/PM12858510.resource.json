	"abstract":{"value":"We report here the cloning and characterization of a UDP-glucose flavonoid glucosyltransferase (srUFGT) in Stevia rebaudiana. The isolated cDNA was 1419 bp in length encoding 473 deduced amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 53.2 kDa. The products of in vitro translation from an expression vector had anthocyanidins and steviol glucosyltransferase activity. Comparison of the activity of the recombinant UDP-glucosyltransferase toward a range of acceptor substrates suggests that it may participate in the synthesis of steviol glycosides. The results support the hypothesis that the flavonoid glucosyltransferases, which have a broad substrate specificity, may be not only involved in flavonoid glucosylation but also play a role in producing the water-soluble steviol-glycosides in S. rebaudiana."}
