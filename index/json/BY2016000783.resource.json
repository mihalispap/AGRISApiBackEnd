		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the dynamic development of the medicinal raw materials of the Republic of Belarus as a sub-sector of agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the market is divided into economic entities: subjects of the agrarian sector, that is agricultural cooperatives and unitary enterprise engaged in the cultivation of medicinal plants, as farmers and private enterprises, etc.; enterprises for the primary and advanced processing; company engaged in the marketing herbal drugs and its products, that is wholesale and retail sector. Particular attention is paid to the harvesting of wild medicinal plants. Market analysis of medicinal plants indicates that Belarus has a significant biological reserve, but harvesting of medicinal plants produced in insufficient quantities. Although in the dynamics is observed a progress in the collection of medicinal herbs by agricultural organizations, but the level of needs of processing organizations not yet have been achieved in large measure due to the lack of consumer cooperatives specialized facilities for raw material drying. A number of issues on the market, including the increasing collection of wild plants were proposed.",
