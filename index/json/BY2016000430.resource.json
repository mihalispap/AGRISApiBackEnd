		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented the data about conditions of the maintenance of cows in premises of the facilitated type and capital, constructed on standard projects is cited; the data about level of reproductive abilities at cows. It is established that level of reproductive abilities at cows substantially depend on conditions of the maintenance of animals. The level of reproductive abilities at cows substantially depends on conditions of the maintenance of animals. Cows maintenance in the capital rooms, constructed on standard projects, leads to increase impregnation after the first insemination during the winter and transitive year periods on 5,0 and 1,0% accordingly; to increase of calves output on 27,8%; to increase in calves alive weight at a birth on 2,3%; to reduction service-period at cows on 41,8%, barrenness - in 5,7 times, quantities of deadborn and abortion fetus on 60,5%. The maintenance of cows in rooms of the facilitated type leads to increase of cows impregnation after the first insemination during the summer period of year on 14,2%.",
