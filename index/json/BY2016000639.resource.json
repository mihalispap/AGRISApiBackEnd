		{"value":"In course of the long-term research there was studied the use of glutinous color sticky traps for monitoring of cucumber midge (Bradysia brunnipes) in the protected soil. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in stationary hothouses of the unitary enterprise 'Agrocombinat Zhdanovichi' (Minsk region) in 2005-2008. As a result of realized research it was experimentally revealed that for cucumber midge imagos, yellow coloured traps were more attractive - the number of the wrecker on yellow coloured traps was 13-1.5 times higher, than on blue coloured ones. Cucumber midge imagos were attracted to traps on the whole plant height, however their maximum quantity was caught at the distance of 40 cm (and lower) from substratum surface. Monitoring of cucumber midge made it possible to establish that the number of wrecker generations reached 8 generations for a vegetative season. The conducted researches showed the prospects of the use of glutinous coloured sticky traps for the identification of primary centers of cucumber midge distribution in the protected soil, and for studying of dynamics of wrecker number throughout a vegetative season.",
