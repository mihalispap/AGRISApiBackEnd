		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the status and sets out the challenges in the field of drying and aeration of grains and seeds, discusses the physical, biochemical properties of the grains, the processes occurring in the grain mass at drying. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research there were described the results of theoretical and experimental studies of drying fixed and moving grain layers in technology, design and operation modes dryers, research and testing, state and prospects of development of post-harvest grain handling, quality control, grain and seed in the post-harvest handling and storage, basic parameters and patterns of grain drying process, technology and equipment of low-temperature drying of grain by aeration, drying technology and equipment with continuous grain flow, automatic computer control of processes grain drying, the rationale and calculation of basic parameters, testing and application of systems for fixed-bed drying of grain by aeration.",
