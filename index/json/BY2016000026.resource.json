		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied aspects of industrial accidents and occupational diseases in Agro industrial complex of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research there were revealed a range of issues to improve the OSH management system in the agricultural organizations, aimed at reducing the number of injuries and diseases on the basis of reduction of occupational risks, improvement of the safety of equipment operation and maintenance processes, improvement of working conditions in the production of agricultural products. There were considered such questions as Occupational Safety and Health management system; the safety of agricultural production, analysis of performance indicators in health; probabilistic forecasting of occupational injuries, ergonomics, physiological aspects, assessment of socio-economic benefits, the risk of injury parameters in technological processes; study of the effectiveness of the alignment device electrical potential on-farm cattle; questions of ensure safety in crop; normalization on the parameters of industrial environment, affecting on occupational diseases; certification of working conditions at workplaces; adequate ventilation in the premises; calculation of natural and mechanical ventilation, reduction of emissions, reduction of industrial noise, protection against vibration in the workplace , industrial lighting and its normalization, calculation methodology of artificial lighting and others.",
