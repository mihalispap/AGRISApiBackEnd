		{"value":"According to the State scientific and technical program "Agroindustrialcomplex - steady development" for 2011-2015 is stipulated the complex of actions on creation of new industry lines of horses of Belarusian draught breed. Breeding value of stallions and mares was determined on parameters to their own efficiency (phenotype) which are an estimation in 10-ball system by origin, typicalness, to measurements, the ex-terrier and the constitution which is carried out at horses judging in facilities.The results of determining the breeding value of the Belarusian draught breed of horses by indices is presented in the article. It is established, that the linear statistical models, being the theoretical basis of the definitions of animals breeding value on quantitative attributes, can be used in algorithms at definition of breeding value of horses Belarusian draught breed. On this basis the breeding value is expressed by rejection of size of an attribute of an estimated horse from average on breed. Breeding value is characterized by value of the complex index consisting of the sum of individual indexes of breeding value to separate attributes. The complex index general formula of breeding value of a stallion-producer Belarusian draught breed is developed. Established high range estimation of producers of the Bor Lesnoj and Ranok created lines causes expediency of their further directed use in breeding work",
