		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied influence of crop fertilization systems on the activity of the key biochemical processes associated with the cycles of carbon and nitrogen (ammonification, mineralization of carbohydrates, humification) in sod-podzolic loamy soil and determined the most ecologically based system of fertilizer, providing a saving level of biological activity. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in Minsk region in 2011-2012. As a result of realized research it was revealed that on sod-podzolic light-loamy soil was the most reasonable system of fertilization, focused on maintaining the balance of phosphorus and potassium in the soil with a split application of nitrogen fertilizer N54 and N72 on backgrounds P60K132, that provided the highest yield grain-grass crop rotation (126.2 and 124.5 c of fodder units/ha) at saving level of soil enzymatic activity (132-160%) and mineralization of organic matter (143-162%). Higher rates of overall level of enzyme activity in the soil were marked with the support system of fertilizer (N18-54P60K132) -142-168%, with recorded increased invertase (2275-2933 mg of glucose/kg) and urease (187.5 - 210.0 mg of N-NH4+/kg) activity and thus increased mineralization of carbon and nitrogen-containing organic compounds of soil which was 156-185%. When fertilizer systems aimed at the use of residual amounts of P and K in the soil (N18-54), as well as deficiency of phosphorus and potassium (N18-54P30K66) overall level of enzymatic activity (113-124% or 125-146%, respectively) and mineralization of organic matter (118-132% and 134-153%, respectively) was reduced, the productivity of crop rotation was 113.6-115.0 and 120.1-123.4 c of fodder units/ha, respectively.",
