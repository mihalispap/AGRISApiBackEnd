		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the questions of foreign direct investment (FDI) to economy of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research it was revealed that (FDI) as a form of international capital movement is the major catalyst for economic development of any country. The problem of FDI increase is relevant and practically significant for Belarus due to the limited internal funding sources. The conditions for the formation of a favorable investment climate with the experience of foreign countries are defined, trends and ways of attracting private equity investors in accordance with the needs of economic restructuring and innovation development are analyzed, FDI inflow in the country's agriculture is considered. Today in Belarus 83 farms have high production and efficiency (7%). About 22% of the total number of farms is the organizations with a low level of production. It is they who will be given priority when upgrading. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, for the modernization of agriculture sector until 2015 it will be allocated 64 trillion rubles. It will own funds of enterprises, foreign investments and loans. It should focus on creating the necessary conditions and improving the investment climate for the industry dynamic development, as the government is seriously interested in the impact of the substantial funds that the country invests in agriculture development.",
