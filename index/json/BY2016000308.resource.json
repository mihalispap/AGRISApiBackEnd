		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the content of the main mineral nutrients and their correlations in leaves of the tree species of most often used in gardening of Minsk (the Republic of Belarus). The complex of laboratorial and field research was realized in 2006-2008. The objects of research were common horse chestnut  (Aesculus Hippocastanum L.), little-leaved linden (Tilia cordata Mill.), Norway maple (Acerplatanoides L.), American arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis L.). Infringements in leaves of the weakened trees and nutrients correlations (H/P, P/Ca, Ca/P and Na/K), without essential correlations changes of К/(Ca+Mg) (Ca + Mg)/К were revealed. The results showed that under the conditions of Minsk chemical composition of the batteries and their ratio in the leaves of the horse chestnut varied depending on the season, the state spaces (with no signs of abating and weakened trees) and the distance from the road. It was found that in the weakened plants of linden trees compared with no signs of abating in the distance 1.5 m from the road in the spring there was an increase in potassium and magnesium in 1.2 times and sodium in 1.7 times, in the autumn - increasing only sodium in 5.2 times. The leaves of viable and damaged trees of maple revealed the same pattern as that of the horse chestnut. The content of major nutrients and sodium in the needles of Thuja slightly varied with the seasons.",
