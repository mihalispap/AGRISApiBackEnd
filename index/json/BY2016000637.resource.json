		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the growth processes differed by frost tolerance of winter triticale (Triticosecale) varieties of various sowing dates. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus.  As a result of realized research it was revealed that at the 1st stage of organogenesis, plants of more frost tolerant varieties had higher increase value than plants of less frost tolerant varieties. At the 2-nd stage of organogenesis, it was observed the inverse reaction - plants of less frost tolerant varieties had more rapid growth than plants of more frost tolerant varieties. The dependence of the average daily plant increase on plant morphological development was determined. Plants with 1-2 leaves had higher daily increase than plants with 1-4 lateral shoots at the same mean daily temperature. This trend was observed in both more frost-hardy and less frost-hardy varieties. The high degree of correlation between the change of mean daily air temperature and the intensity of growth processes in plants was shown.",
