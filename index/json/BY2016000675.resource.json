		{"value":"The investigation results on inoculation terms influence on quality and exit of fruit crops planting material (apple-tree, pear, plum, cherry) grown up in traditional technology and with closed root system (in containers) were presented in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. It has been revealed, that saplings in containers surpassed the saplings which are grown up within traditional technology in 1,5 – 2,5 times by the quantity of the generated lateral shoots and in 1,5 – 3 times by the quantity of generated kidneys. Inoculation carrying out during the summer period at cultivation of fruit crops saplings in traditional technology has allowed to increase an exit of a planting material of an apple-tree ('Imant') by 9 %, pear tree ('Byelorusskoye pozdneye') by 5 %, plum tree  ('Kroman') by 9% and cherry tree ('Vyanok') by 16% in comparison with a variant of spring inoculation of similar cultures. At cultivation of fruit crops planting material with closed root system in a variant with summer inoculation carry out of the increase in an exit of a planting material has been noted: of an apple tree – by 24%, pear tree – by 9%, plum tree – by 18%, cherry tree – by 9% in comparison with a spring inoculation variant of the same cultures. Cultivation of a planting material with closed root system, using the container of 5 litres volume, filled with substrate Florabel-5 + perlite (1: 1), will allow to receive not less  than 75,5 – 80,0 thousand units of fruit crops saplings from hectare with profitability of 441,1 – 462,8% and profit of 400,1 – 427,6 thousand USD from hectare.",
