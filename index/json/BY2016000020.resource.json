		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the aspects of use of biofuels in diesel engines work. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research practical recommendations on the use of agricultural machinery diesel engines using biofuels were resulted, the dependences of the technical-operational and environmental performance of diesel engines on the composition of biofuels were considered, the recommendations for use of diesel fuel equipment, the use of biofuels in the winter and rapid analysis of its quality were done. Biofuels based on rapeseed oil is an alternative fuel for diesel engines of tractors of the Minsk Tractor Plant with a slight change in cardinality and economic indicators. When translating the D-243 with a diesel to biofuel power was changed to 2.0 kW or 3.4%. Specific fuel consumption increased by 28.6 r/kWh or 11.8%. Reduction in the effective power of the diesel engine was accounted for difference of the lower heating value of biodiesel and diesel fuel. The tests revealed that the increase in a mixed composition proportion of biofuel reduces smoke exhaust fuel B5 by 3%, B10 by 5%, B30 by 10%, B100 by 19%. According to the research the optimal fuel injection timing angle can be no adjustment. It was found that the optimal type of biodiesel can be mixtures composition, winter operation - no more than 10% biodiesel, the rest (90%) of diesel fuel, for summer use - no more than 30% biodiesel, the rest (70%) of diesel fuel. With such a ratio of effective power reduction and an increase in fuel consumption will be in the range of 3-5% at a significantly reduced.",
