		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented research results on dependence of grain efficiency of millet (Panicum miliaceum) on the hydrothermal conditions developing in vegetation of culture on sandy soils of the southwest of the country. The aim of the study was to set the pattern of change in grain yield of millet under the influence of the amount of precipitation, air temperature, as well as their joint effect as a whole during the growing season, and depending on their distribution by periods. It is established that to the greatest degree productivity of grain influence the sum of deposits for the vegetative period and character of their distribution in separate phases of development of culture. Based on the results of regression analysis there was revealed a positive relationship of millet grain productivity on rainfall during the growing season grown on the sod- podzolic sandy loam soils. There was marked a positive conjugation between yield and number of days with precipitation, as well as yield and length of the growing season. It was determined that the weather conditions in the early phases of development of millet have a negligible effect on the formation of millet crop yield.",
