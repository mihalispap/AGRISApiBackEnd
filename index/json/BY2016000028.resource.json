		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied the breeding process of self-pollinating crops with a view to its improvement through a systematic approach to its organization and management in the context of the development of the theory of selection process. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research there was presented logic, stages and components of a system and an information technology management software by selection process on the basis of modern computer equipment, system factors in it. The need for a practical approach and the optimal alignment of the field of selection process and the latest biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques were presented. The influence of research on optimization of the selection process and the basic components of the theory of optimization were given.",
