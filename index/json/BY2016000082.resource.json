		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the problems of processing of the contaminated products. The research was realized in the conditions of the Mogilev State University of Foodstuffs in the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research there were summarized the results of research on reducing the content of radioactive substances in the consumption of agricultural and food products of forests and water bodies by means of its technological processing and cooking, as well as the formation of the radiation situation in the Mogilev region, migration of 137Cs and 90Sr in the soil of forest and field biogeocenoces distribution and long-term dynamics of accumulation of radionuclides in agricultural products, the main components of food production forests and waters. The influence of the natural radionuclides of terrestrial origin, the global fallout of radioactive substances on the radiological situation in Belarus, their accumulation in the cultivated products was analyzed. Forward-looking statements of radiation, radionuclide migration and accumulation in agricultural products, food products of forests and water bodies were presented.",
