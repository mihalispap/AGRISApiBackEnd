		{"value":"In course of the research there was realized the assessment of potential soil blowing, which confirmed the urgency of measure preparation regarding wind erosion soil stability increase including ameliorators application, cultivation systems upgrading and soil protective crop rotations introduction, by the example of wind velocities distribution in the April month according to weather station Slavgorod. As a result of realized research it was revealed, that wind erosion-preventive measures realization, permitting to increase initial quadratic velocity for light mineral soils, for example from 5.5 to 7 m/c, decreased predictable wind erosion intensity more than fourfold. For an estimation of deflationary potential of wind concerning a concrete respectable surface it was necessary to know repeatability of various winds high-speed gradation, critical speed of wind for the given soil surface and the average value of the deflation dangerous wind speeds taking into account the greatest speeds with repeatability, beginning from 0.05-0.1%. It would make it possible for given soil to define degree of danger of all possible winds in the deflation dangerous periods.",
