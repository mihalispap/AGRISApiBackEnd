		{"value":"Bacterial content of boar semen and of uterine medium in sows during postnatal period was studied and efficacy of the investigational agent fertilifil C in the boar semen extender was determined. Aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms such as E. coli, Staph. Epidermidis ahd Proteus mirabilis were found in boar semen; Citrobacter freundii, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli were found in the contents of sow uterus. The found microorganisms showed high sensitivity to different antibiotics and the agent. In case of insemination of sows with gentamicin and fertilifil C supplemented semen conception rate in both groups was the same: 88,8 % of animals farrowed in each group. However, reproductive performance of animals was different. When fertilifil C was supplemented to the extender the number of technological pigs rose at the expense of the decrease in the number of sows in whose litter there were pigs born dead; due to the increase in litter weight and in the weight of newborn pigs and because of some increase in the number of pigs in the litter. At post weaning time larger number of sows came in heat during the first 4–5 days. Efficacy of the agent for the semen of boars with average performance was higher than that of highly fecund ones. The biggest difference is in the number of technological pigs.",
