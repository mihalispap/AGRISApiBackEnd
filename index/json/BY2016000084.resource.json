		{"value":"In course of the research there were studied the problems of the return introduction of European bison (Bison bison bonasus) in the Pripyat region. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. As a result of realized research there were summed up the experience and summed up the introduction return. Attention was paid to the evolution of the Bison genus, its geographical distribution in the geological past, the history of the disappearance and recovery of bison, return it to nature. The natural conditions of the region and the National Park 'Pripyat' were characterized; stages and reintroduction techniques were described. The dynamics of population, reproductive performance and structure of micropopulations of this species were shown; factors leading to them were identified. The trend of development of the territory, characteristics of the habitats of micropopulations were given. The features of biotopical bison confinement were determined, forage base and their impact on trees and shrubs in Polesie was evaluated. The results of 137Cs in the organs and tissues of the bison were presented. The appropriateness and feasibility of establishing of Pripyat population of the species was grounded.",
