		{"value":"The article presents the literary review for the ways of seedling cultivation of black currant and gooseberry in the standard form. Recently cultivation of black currant and gooseberry in a tree form not only among summer residents, but also on small commercial plantations in different countries, has become popular. According to experts, 'trees' of these traditional shrubby horticultural crops are less affected by diseases, give larger crop and higher quality than bushes. It is easier to feed up them, water and loosen soil under them. It is connected with rarer placing of branches, good light exposure and their airing. However cultivation of such type of plants demands high qualification from the gardener, increase in expenses based on planting material cost for crops planting. In Belarus traditional planting material of berry bushes is basically presented by scion rooted saplings with open or closed root system. It is required to produce scion rooted as well as inoculated planting material for increase of nursery competitiveness.",
