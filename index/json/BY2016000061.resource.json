		{"value":"The book represents wide-scale analysis of the problems of utilization of mineral resources as the material basis of economic development in the present conditions and the economic efficiency of geological exploration of mineral resources. Topical theoretical and methodological issues of economic evaluation of mineral resources in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus are presented. The possibility of using the results of the economic evaluation of deposits of various minerals for the development of administrative decisions that ensure the rational use of mineral resources in the current market conditions are analyzed on the basis of generalizations. The results of the geological and economic evaluation of the cost of deposits by minerals' types are displayed and a forecast of their effective use is made. Mineral resources as the material basis of economic development of a country are analyzed; classification of the reserves of mineral resources is suggested. Methods of mineral resources' development (open development, underground mining, and combined development) are researched; economic efficiency of exploration and scientific basis for the economic evaluation of mineral deposits is analyzed. Economic evaluation of different types of mineral resources (geothermal resources, cretaceous, hydrocarbons, peat and natural stone) is suggested. Evaluation of projects for the development of mineral deposits, taking into account the uncertainty and risk is made, justification of the charge for the extraction of minerals on the basis of the valuation of deposits is offered, rent relations in the system of subsurface resources management are researched.",
