		{"value":"In course of the research there was studied a comparative effect of doses and complex fertilizers with micronutrient supplements and biologically active substances, as well as nitrogen and sulfur-containing fertilizers used for the main application to the soil on crop roots carrot (Daucus carota), which was removed in the early stages of realization and lay in storage. The research was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in field experiments in farm enterprise 'Gorizont' (Grodno region) on sod-podzolic gleyed loose sandy loam soil in 2011-2012. As a result of realized research it was revealed that application of chlorine and chlorine-free complex, as well as nitrogen-sulfur-containing fertilizers (background RK) supplemented with micronutrients or trace elements and plant growth regulator in Ehpin technology of carrot cultivation was a promising farming techniques which made it possible to increase productivity and improve its quality. For two years of research the maximum yield and gain of carrot roots in both early and late harvesting time was obtained from the NPK complex with S, B, Cu (14-10-19) with yields in early harvesting 36.9 t/ha and later - 76.0 t/ha, as well as a slow form NPK with S, B with yields in 39.7 and 83.2 t/ha , respectively, at a dose of entering N90P64 K122, where the root gain obtained 4.1 and 6.9 t/ha in comparison with the introduction of the standard fertilizers and 3.4-6.2 t/ha - from complex fertilizers without additives. At early harvesting of carrots best dose was N90P64K122, at late terms - N110P78K149.",
