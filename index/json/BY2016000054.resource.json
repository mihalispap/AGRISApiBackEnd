		{"value":"The book analyzes use of mixed fuels based on rapeseed oil for agricultural equipment, especially tractors. The use of alternative fuels for automotive vehicles is evaluated; global trends in the use of sustainable alternative fuels for automotive vehicles are analyzed. Classification of renewable alternative fuels used for automotive vehicles, the impact of alternative fuels on the basis of rapeseed oil on the performance of the working process of a diesel is presented. Effect of fuels derived from rapeseed oil on the work of the fuel system of diesel, the impact of alternative fuels on the basis of rapeseed oil on the combustion process in a diesel engine, the performance of the tractor when working on mixed fuels, traction and fuel-economic quality of tractors working on mixed fuels is shown. Influence of the tractor on the environment by using mixed fuels and reliability of the tractors using mixed fuels is discussed. Upgraded elements of tractors and cars to run on rapeseed oil along with theoretical foundations of mixed fuel on the basis of rapeseed oil in tractors are suggested. Effect of drop-in fuels based on rapeseed oil on the operational performance of wheeled tractor is evaluated; changing of traction qualities of wheel tractor during replacement of diesel fuel with mixed fuel based on rapeseed oil is analyzed. Development of the device controlling the composition of mixed fuel is suggested; cost-effectiveness of a wheel tractor with a device for controlling the composition of mixed fuel is described.",
