		{"value":"In course of research there was studied the effectiveness of fungicidal (Maxim XL, Vincit, Insure Perform), insecticidal and fungicidal treaters (Prestige, Celeste top) for protection of blue lupine (Lupinus angustifolius) against root rots. The field tests were realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus in 2011-2012. As a result of realized research there was revealed that the within 20 days after sprouting the biological effectiveness of disinfectants Maxim XL, Prestige, Celeste top, Vincit and Insure Perform was 80.4-89.3%. During the growing season was the dynamic growth of the plant root system infestation by root rot. In stem extension stage of lupine (40 days after sprouting) biological efficacy of disinfectants was greatly reduced, and in the case of the use of Maxim XL (1.0 l/t), Prestige (1.0 l/t), Vincit (2.0 l/t), Insure Perform (0.4 l/t) - 44.6; 50.8; 36.8; 54.6% respectively. Biological effectiveness of insect-fungicides Celeste top against fungal diseases was 73.8% (1.5 l/t) and 76.1% (2.0 l/t). High biological efficiency of the fungicides provided reliable increase of lupine yield: Maxim XL (1.0 l/t) and Insure Perform (0.5 l/t) yielded 4.2 t/ha of additional products, Insure Perform (0.4 l/t), Vincit (2.0 l/t) and Prestige (1.0 l/t) - 6.3, 7.8 and 8.2 t/ha. The maximum crop yield increase was obtained in seed dressings drug Celeste top – 10.0-10.8 t/ha with the average yield in the control of 23.1 t/ha.",
