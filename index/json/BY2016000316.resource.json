		{"value":"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented the results of studies of physical and chemical structure, amino acid structure, food value amaranth seeds and flour amaranth (Amaranthus) native for the most rational use in the food-processing industry. In amaranth seeds 7-8 % of fat oil which onfatty-acid is close to structure to corn contain, but has a number of essential advantages. Vitamin E in amaranth oil is in especially active to the form and that is even more important, in it contains to 10% of scvalen. Found high level of the maintenance of fiber and amino acid structure. Quality of fiber of an amaranth is very high, because of the considerable maintenance of the irreplaceable amino acids, in particular valuable amino acid -lizin (4,3-5,7% to the general fiber of seeds), that twice more than at wheat and three times more than at corn and copzo, and even are comparable by quantity to a soya and the cow milk. It is defined that amaranth starch contains to 79 % of weight of an amaranth, possesses unique properties. The size of its grain several times is less, than, rice and corn.",
