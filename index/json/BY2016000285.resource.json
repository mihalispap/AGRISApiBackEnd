		{"value":"In course of the research there was reviewed the component structure of the soil cover of protected areas of Belarus. As a result of realized research its small representative was noted and necessity of creation of the Red Book of Belarus soils for the purpose of preservation of the reference variants of natural soils was substantiated. It was revealed that the network of reserves and national parks not completely reflected a variety of componental structure of soil cover of Belarus, and consequently, and the biological variety connected with a cover, as soil - the basic ecological niche for existence of overwhelming majority of plants and land animals. The list of the basic soils meeting in reserves and national parks of Belarus, approximately on 56% represented all variety of componental structure of soil cover. Creation of the Red book of Belarus soils and cadastre of reference, rare and disappearing soils would be the first step to preservation of their geographical and genetic variety in territory of the Republic of Belarus.",
