		{"value":"The comparative study of apple (Malus) cultivars on the rootstocks 62-396 and PB-4 in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus showed, that the use of PB-4 apple rootstock resulted into significant decrease in indexes of trees growth and development (stem diameter up to 42%, tree height up to 41%, crown volume up to 70%), fruits dimension up to 25% and the crop sum up to 63%. Thereby it does not allow estimating objectively new cultivar samples on a complex of economically valuable signs. It is established that the use of the rootstock 62-396 with obligatory installation of a support allows realizing more fully the genetic potential of apple cultivars on fruits efficiency and quality. Also it helps to reduce the testing time of promising cultivar samples for elite selection and transferring them to the State Variety Trial. Seed rootstock use is reasonable for early fruit bearing cultivars of a new generation. It is especially up-to-date for planting it on light soils and at planting orchards in primary regions with mechanical harvesting application. The seed rootstock of the seedlings of the cultivar 'Antonovka' differs by good compatibility with all cultivars. It is relatively undemanding to soils and irrigation and it does not need a support.",
