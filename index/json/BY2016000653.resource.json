		{"value":"In course of the research there was analyzed fractional composition of 10 varieties and variety samples of tetraploid buckwheat of different morphotypes. The research was realized in the central part of the Republic of Belarus in the Research and Practical Centre of National Academy of Science of Belarus for Arable Farming in selection crop rotation of industrial plot 'Zazerje' on sod-podzolic, light loamy soil in 2006-2011. Realized research during the 6 years showed that grain size increase of determinate forms was due to the increase in the largest fraction (5.5 mm) and could be provided by hull increase, not core increase. However, in the changing environmental conditions, the ability to grain size stabilizing came down. Growing conditions reducing thousand-kernel weight at the same time had an impact on the increase of hull content of buckwheat grain. Reaction of fractional structure to changing conditions of growth depended a little on plant morphotype and on a method of variety creation. In more degrees reaction of fractional structure depended on a variety genotype.",
