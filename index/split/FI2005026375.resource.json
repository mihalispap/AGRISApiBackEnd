	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Carcass characteristics of 120 male and 120 female Anak type broiler chicken were compared at different slaughter weights. The birds were fed with concentrate diet containing 22.15% crude protein (cp) and 3.20 kcal/kg metabolizable energy (ME). The birds were slaughtered at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 kg body weights. The external and internal offals and all the primal cuts were individually removed and weighed. The mean weights of most of the offal and primal cuts increased with increasing slaughter weight. The female birds had a better dressing out percentage (P>0.05) than the males. However, sex differences in most of the offal and primal cuts were not significantly (P> 0.05) different."}
