	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"To study the effect of chemical industry effluent on macrophage functions in mice, 128 mice of 2 weeks age were procured and dividedinfourequal groups. These mice were vaccinated with Ranikhet disease vaccine (R,B) strain intraperitonealy @O.lml and were treatedwithchemicalindustry effluent as drinking water for 4 months. The functional activity of macrophages was assessed by nitroblue tetrazoliumreduction assay. The test was conducted at 90 days and 120 days of experiment. The results indicated a significant depression of macrophagefunctions as evidenced by a reduction in NBT positive cells in chemical industry effluent treated mice at 90 days and 120 days a/experiment in comparison to controls. This depression of macrophage activity may result in increased susceptibility of host to various infections.",
