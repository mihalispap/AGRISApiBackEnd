	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The present study was conducted to study the role performance in goat farming activities in Tamil Nadu. The data were collected personally from 120 goat owning farm families with the help of structured interview schedule developed for the study. In goat farming, independent participation of women was noticed in the practices of colostrum feeding, grazing of animals, collection and disposal of pellets, feeding, watering, care of pregnant animals, care at kidding time, providing special feed to kidded animals and cleaning of pens. Joint participation with the spouse, however was found in the activities like cleaning and grooming of animals, chaffing of fodder, care of young one immediately after birth, providing special feed and medicine to sick and deworming of animals. Males were more involved in health care, decision making and marketing related activities. It was concluded that goat keeping was an integral part of livelihood of rural families. Rural women were the active workers in most of the indoor activities of goat farming whereas males were engaged more in outdoor activities. Both men and women were managing the activities of goat farming. Thus they may be encouraged to take goat farming as entrepreneurial activity for better earning and sustainable livelihood.",
