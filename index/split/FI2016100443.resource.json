	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Protein extracts from a species of desert truffle (Terfezia claveryi Chatin) were analyzed using polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method. The sporocarps (fruiting bodies) of truffles from studied area in Tarom (Zanjan Province, Iran) were used as the source of materials and comminuted with sample buffer. Electrophoresis of native proteins gave more than 13 bands in the 15-205 kDa molecular weight range with mobilities of 4.6, 10.7, 15.3, 21.5, 25.7, 27.6, 30.7, 36.9, 40, 52.3, 53.8, 58.4 and 64.6 %. There were one major band (L), 4 prominent bands (A, D, F, G) and 8 minor bands (B, C, E, H, I, J, K, M). The major band L which corresponded to the truffles important storage protein was focused to about 20 kDa. In this research important native storage proteins of desert truffle were analyzed to 13 special proteins. This report is the first study on electrophoretic protein banding in Iranian terfezia."}
