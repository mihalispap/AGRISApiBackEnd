	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The present study was undertaken to examine the role of nitric oxide on the modulation of Ca  in the urinary bladder muscles of goat. CaCl 2  (10 -5  M â 10 -2  M) induced cumulative concentration-contraction curves were generated at an increment of 0.5 log unit in isolated detrusor muscle strips in organ bath studies. SNP (sodium nitroprusside) and SINâ1(3-morpholino-sydnonimines) at a concentration of 10 -6  M and 10 -5  M were used to study the role of NO on extra cellular Ca 2+ . Results were compared with a known L-type Ca 2+  channel blocker, nifedipine (10 M). In another set of experiments, to study the role of NO on intra-cellular Ca 2+ , carbachol (CCh, 10 -4 M) induced sub-maximal contractions of detrusor tissues were produced in Ca 2+ -free EGTA containing PSS either in the absence or presence of SNP and SIN-1. The present investigation showed that NO donors SIN-1 and SNP concentration dependently shifted the concentration-contraction curves of CaCl  The NO donors also inhibited the CCh-induced contraction. Thus, it can beconcluded that SNP and SIN-1 are inhibitors of both extracellular as well as intracellular Ca in goat detrusor muscle.",
