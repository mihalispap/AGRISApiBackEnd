	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The influence of leaf characters such as leaf hairiness and leaf thickness of brinjal (Solanum melongena L. var. esculentum) accessions in host plant selection of whitefly Bemisia tabaci was studied. The hairy varieties viz., Hisar Jamuni followed by DBR 31 and PY 356 (1739.8, 1649.4 and 1302.4 trichomes cm-2) contained more B. tabaci than the glabrous varieties EP 106 and EP 89 (528.4 and 559.6 trichomes cm-2). Leaf thickness varied significantly among the selected accessions, the highest values being 448.2 and 441.6 µm in EP 89 and EP 106 respectively. The minimum leaf thickness 211.4 µm was found in the case of Hisar jamuni. The hairiness correlated positively and the leaf thickness negatively with the occurrence of B. "}
