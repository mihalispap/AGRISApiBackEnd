Among the different postharvest treatments, application of salicylic acid @ 400 mgl-1 was found the most suitable in respect of increased soluble solid content and overall fruit quality and decreased fruit infection, followed by Ca-EDTA @ 1000mgl-1 and boric acid @ 0.2%. While the maximum fruit decay was noted in untreated control. Salicylic acid, a natural and safe phenolic compound, may be considered for its wide application in controlling postharvest losses of strawberry fruits.",
