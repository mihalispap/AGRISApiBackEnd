	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"An on-farm experiment was conducted on an Oxic Paleustalf (Ferric Luvisol) in southwestern Nigeria in 1993 and 1995 seasons. Aim was to determine optimum K fertilization for these crops and to determine most economic fertilizer rate. A randomised complete block design with four replications was adopted. Fertilizer was applied at the rates of K 120, 240, 360 and 480 kg ha-1 and a control. Results showed that the following attributes: number of hands and fingers bunch-1, mean length of plantain bunch as well as mean bunch and total bunch weight responded significantly (p<0.05) to K applied and maximum yield were obtained at K 360 kg ha-1 in both cropping seasons. Optimum fertilization for melon was K 240 kg ha-1. Results of the partial budgeting method for the intercrop at different K fertilization applied were 10,000 (or $384.60) in 1993 and 6,700 ($257.69) in 1995 cropping seasons."}
