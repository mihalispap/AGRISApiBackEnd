	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The wheat production still remains beneath the national consumption in Algeria and undergoes quantitative and qualitative variations. To understand the fluctuations in cereal production at a regional level, soft and hard wheat (Triticum aestivum, T. durum) varieties grown on the same locations were sampled in three non-successive periods and analyzed for quality characteristics. Our study demonstrated the positive impact of the rainfall during the 2003 season on the specific weight (74.86-83.70 kg hl-1) and the one thousand-kernel weight (TKW 34.89-46.90 g) almost through the four locations studied. The increase of the average TKW was remarkable between 1999 and 2003 for the variety Vitron (10.74%). The impact of the external factors on the vitreousness of the hard wheat varieties (84.31-93.04%) was also studied. The protein content of the seeds showed highly positive correlations with rainfall (r1 exceeds +0.80), but no clear relationship between the temperature and the quality factors was detected in most of the locations (r2 ranged from 0 to â€“ 0.9)."}
