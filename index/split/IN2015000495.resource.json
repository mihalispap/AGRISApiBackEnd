	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Results revealed that mean larval population of Helicoverpa armigera was considerably low after insecticidal sprays in different modules and lowest population of the insect (2.59/MRL) was recorded in Module 6 (spinosad @ 0.5 ml/l of water as 1st spray and indoxacarb @1 ml/l as 2nd spray) followed by Module 4 (indoxacarb @1.0 ml/l as 1st spray and triozophos @1.5 ml/l as 2nd spray) and Module 1 (spinosad @ 0.5 ml/l as 1st spray and triazophos @1.5 ml/l as 2nd spray) in 2009-2010. Similar results were also observed during 2010-2011. However, based on benefit-cost ratio, module 1 (1.57 &1.70) proved more viable than module 6 (1.39 &1.56) and module 4 (1.35 &1.55) due to lower cultivation cost in both the seasons.",
