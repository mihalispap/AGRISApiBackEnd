The rats were allocated into 6 dietary treatment groups of 6 rats each and fed with diet containing graded levels of BSG 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 100%. The experimental feeding lasted for fifteen days. The BSG formulated diet was found to have a positive effect on the growth performance of the rats up to levels of 12% including the control (0%). The histopathological evaluation shows that 3â€“9% BSG could be used as protein supplement in human foods."}
