	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"This research was carried out to determine the effect of aqueous (AE) and ethanolic skin extracts (EE) of Anadenanthera macrocarpa on the oviposition and the egg eclodibility of teleogines of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. The concentrations used were AE and EE 8.26 mg.mL-1 and 12.5 mg mL-1, respectively. As for the tests, we have used 240 ticks for each extract, which were cleaned, weighed and divided into groups of ten. These were immersed in 20 mL of test and control solutions at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes, after they were kept in Petri dishes, procedure which was replicated three times. Distilled H2O and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as negative controls and Amitraz as positive control at a concentration of 0.25 mg mL-1. The results have shown that the EA group immersed for up to sixty minutes has presented a product efficiency of 10.85% (p>0,05), and EE, in thirty minutes, has registered a 35.24% efficiency mark. conclude that the ethanolic extract hasinterfered discreetly in oviposition of ticks in the test considered.",
