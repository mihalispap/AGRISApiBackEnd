	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The aim of this study was to prepare and evaluate a formulated functional cheesecake for diabetics to assess benefits on health. The ingredients of the regular cheesecake were replaced by other ingredients of low caloric value and functional properties. Sucrose was replaced by fructose, butter by olive oil, full cream milk by skimmed milk, whole egg by egg white and cottage cheese by kareesh cheese. Sensory evaluations for both the regular cheesecake and functional cheesecake for diabetics were carried out using scores of the appearance, color, odor, flavor, texture and overall properties. The regular cheesecake and the low calorie cheesecake had a good score. Mean blood glucose level after 120 minutes for the subjects who ate the low calorie cheesecake was 247.28±42.92 mg/dl, while the mean blood glucose level for the subjects who ate the regular breakfast diet was 360±25.05 mg/dl. It can be deduced from the present study that formulated functional cheesecake with fructose, whole wheat, egg white, skimmed milk, kareesh cheese and olive oil would be a great meal replacement diet for diabetics."}
