	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"This paper identifies strategies that would enhance the resilience of micro-credit schemes serving artisanal fishermen who operate under the condition of internal capital rationing in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. The results show that encouraging more experienced fishermen with better management skills, who earn satisfactory net worth to become members of joint liability groups that benefit from the financial services of the micro credit institutions would be invaluable in ensuring success of the joint liability micro credit trials. This must be accompanied with educational programs that not only guarantee adequate publicity on available services and existing lending practices, but also impact positively on their attitude towards the use of credit."}
