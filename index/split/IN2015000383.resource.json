Season of birth of kids had significant (P0.01) influence on birth weight in all three genetic groups. There was no significant effect of sex on birth weight in Black Bengal kids, however, significant effect of sex was observed in Beetal and Sirohi half-breds. Type of birth, parity of dam and weight of dam at kidding had significant (P0.05) effect on birth weight of kids in all three genetic groups.",
