	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A study was conducted in 18 male goats suffering from urethral obstruction and subsequently treated surgically. Rectal temperature did not show significant alterations during pre- and post-operative periods whereas, the respiration and heart rates showed elevated levels before treatment and tended to decline after treatment. The haemoglobin, packed cell volume, total leukocyte count, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus and total protein were higher before treatment, which decreased progressively towards normalcy after the treatment. Neutrophilia was the remarkable finding in all the animals before treatment. Hypocalcaemia and hypoglycaemia were observed in the animals before treatment, which increased progressively towards normalcy after treatment. There was no much alteration in sodium and potassium levels before and after treatment. Hence, clinician in such cases should consider the abnormalities for fluid therapy and immediate treatment to minimize the mortality among goats.",
