	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Enzymatic hydrolysates from lees as by-product produced during sake making using fugu muscle and fin were prepared using six proteases and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities were investigated. The yields of these hydrolysates were high, about 13-46%, and large quantities of proteins were contained in the hydrolysates (about 330-461 Âµg/mg lyophilized powder). ACE inhibitory activities of these hydrolysates increased with increasing the concentration of samples, and some of the hydrolysates for 100 mg/ml perfectly inhibited the activity. The present study indicates that a large number of lees as by-product produced during sake making using fugu muscle and fin can be applied to various fields of functional foods and medicine. It is necessary to make much more effective use of underutilized resources and industrial wastes as lees in the future."}
