	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Vitamin A deficiency results in progressive eye damage. It is a serious problem in the northern and northern east Brazil. Screening some cassava clones and interspecific hybrids for its precursors revealed high level of lutein and trans-β-carotene in a clone namely UnB-400, it has its roots content reaching 236 and 1.24 mg/kg respectively combined to an excellent palatibility. An interspecific hybrid of cassava with M. olignatha showed its leaves to have 9108 mg/kg compared to 780 mg/kg in common cultivars."}
