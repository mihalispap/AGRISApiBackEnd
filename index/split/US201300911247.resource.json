	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The effects of fermentation on antinutrients, vitamins and amino acid contents of sandbox (Hura crepitans) seed were investigated. Concentrations of antinutrients in seeds were as follows: alkaloids 25.6±0.2-5.0±0.3, tannins 18.6±1.5-5.8±1.3, saponins 8.5±0.1-1.4±0.1, oxalate 23.7±0.25-3.6±0.12, phytate 18.1+0.31-7.8+0.13 and cyanide 1.66+0.1-0.6±0.03 mg/100 g. Contents of vitamins included were A 328.1-399.30 IU and E 0.398-0.447, K 0.26 -0.456, C 0-9.21, B1 0-0.29, B2 0-0.23, B6 0-0.46 and B12 0-0.36 mg/100 g. The concentrations of antinutrients decreased and those of vitamins increased significantly (p<0.05) with increase in the period of fermentation (0-96 hrs). Concentrations of amino acids were: lysine 2.34-5.36, histidine 1.58-2.25, aspartate 7.19-22.11, serine 2.86-4.25, glutamate 14.41-18.21, cysteine 0.78-1.85, valine 2.38-4.80, isoleucine 2.80-3.61, leucine 4.16-5.96 and tyrosine 2.21-3.00 g/100 g protein. Fermentation increased concentrations of these amino acids, while the concentrations of the remaining amino acids were reduced. Therefore, fermentation improved the nutritional quality of Hura crepitans seeds in terms of decrease in the concentrations of antinutrients and increase in the concentrations of some amino acids and vitamins."}
