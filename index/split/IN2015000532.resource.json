	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Pooled analysis of two years data indicated that three foliar sprays with carbendazim + mancozeb (0.2%) at 10 days interval starting from initiation of disease symptom was found most effective in controlling the foliar anthracnose of mango, followed by other treatments viz., tricyclazole (0.1 %) and carbendazim (0.1%) which were also found effective. For post harvest anthracnose management, one spray of thiophanate methyl (0.1%) 15 days prior to harvest and then hot water treatment supplemented with thiophanate methyl was found most effective. It was also observed that shelf life of fruits was decreased by 2 or 3 days after post harvest treatments of hot water or hot water supplemented with fungicide.",
