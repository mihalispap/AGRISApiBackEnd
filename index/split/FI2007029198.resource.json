After starvation periods, major part of water was evaporated in each microcosm and salt crystals appeared. No culturable cells were obtained in selective and non-selective media. Salty suspension of each microcosm was inoculated in the yolk sacs of embryonated chicken eggs. Culturable cells were detected in a large proportion of eggs."}
