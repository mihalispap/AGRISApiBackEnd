	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Delignification effluent from a nitrocellulose industry was treated with Aspergillus 2BNL. An experimental design was used to optimize the production of fungus biomass evaluating the influence of time and the contents of sucrose, sodium nitrate and effluent on fungal growth. Aspergillus 2BNL1 was able to decolorize between 70-80% of the effluent without co-substrate in 24 h. In addition to color reduction, TOC (total organic carbon) was also reduced by 55% (72 h). For biomass production the best initial contents of sucrose, sodium nitrate and effluent were 45 g L-1, 3 g L-1 and 35 % (v/v), respectively. The highest biomass concentration in the model was 5.35 g L-1. Under the experimental conditions studied the effluent provided an increase in the production of Aspergillus 2BNL1 biomass."}
