	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Oocytes (1127) were collected from 531 goat ovaries of abattoir origin. Collected oocytes were matured in TCM199 medium containing 5Âµg/ml FSH, 10Âµg/ml LH, 10% FBS and 3 mg/ml BSA at 38.5Â°C in CO  incubator under humidified air. After 27 h of in-vitro maturation oocytes were denuded by hyaluronidase enzyme and by passing repeatedly through fine pipette. After 48h post insemination, oocytes were observed for cleavage. Cleavage rate, 2 cell, 4 cell, 8â 16 cell, morulae and blastocysts were 44%, 17%, 25%, 33.11%, 16% and 2%, respectively. In-vitro produced embryos of 2 - 4 cell stage were surgically transferred into the fallopian tube ipsilateral to the ovary containing corpus luteum of two naturally synchronized surrogate does (8 embryos each). Similarly, 8â16 cell and morula stage embryos were transferred surgically at the tip of uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary containing corpus luteum of 6 naturally synchronized surrogate does (8 embryos each). Following transfer, 2 recipients were initially found pregnant at day 35 th  post transfer by ultrasonography. Subsequently on re-examination at day 60, only 1 recipient was confirmed pregnant and delivered twin offspring of male and female sex after 142 days of gestation.",
