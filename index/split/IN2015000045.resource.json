	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Field screening of 22 mungbean entries for resistance against whitefly and mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) were carried out during 2009 â 2010 at College Farm, College of Agriculture, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad. Resistant check (ML 267) and KM 200 recorded low whitefly population of 1.33 and 1.55/5 plants, respectively, whereas the susceptible check (WGG 2) recorded high mean population of whiteflies (9.11/5 plants) followed by MGG 350 (7.66/5 plants) and UPM 99(6.77/5 plants). The mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) incidence ranged from 5.66 to 58.29%. The resistant check ML 267 (5.66%) followed by LGG 407 (11.87%) recorded less incidence while the susceptible check WGG 2 showed high incidence (58.29%). The mungbean entries were categorized based on their resistance reaction to mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) on 0â5 scale. None of the entries were found to be highly resistant and the resistant check ML 267 (5.66%) showed resistant reaction while 12 entries with 11.87 to 19.12% disease incidence were found moderately resistant. Other 5 entries with 20.48 â 26.73% MYMV disease were moderately susceptible and the susceptible check WGG 2 with 58.29% disease incidence was categorized as highly susceptible. The entry ML 267 which showed resistant reaction to mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) recorded highest yield of 1103 kg/ha. Among the 12 moderately resistant lines, 4 lines viz, LGG 407, MGG 356, KM 200 and NM 1 which recorded the yield ranging from 831 to 972 kg/ha were found to be the promising lines against MYMV.",
