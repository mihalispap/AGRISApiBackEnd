	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The aim was to highlight the effects of rooting media and auxin treatments on rooting and shooting abilities of one bud Rupestris du Lot (Vitis rupestris) American rootstock cuttings. Eight different media (sand, perlite, peat, sawdust, sand+perlite, perlite+peat, sand+perlite+peat and perlite+peat+sawdust) with four different auxin treatments (control, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm IBA) were examined under glasshouse conditions in which intermitted mist units were installed. In the scope of observations, rooting percentage (%), root number, root length (cm), root weight (g), shoot length (cm) and shoot diameter (mm) were determined. Among the media, sand was pioneering for the root number (11.24), root weight (1.33 g), shoot length (30.33 cm) and shoot diameter (3.12 mm), while perlite was the most appropriate media for rooting (93.3%). On the other hand, with the exception of 500 ppm IBA application, which generally augmented some observed criteria, high dose auxin treatments were not found beneficial on the examined investigations."}
