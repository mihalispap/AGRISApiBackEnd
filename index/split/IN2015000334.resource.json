	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Effect of feeding of Morinda citrifolia fruit juice on the growth, production and immune response of Nicobari fowl was conducted. Fresh Morinda citrifolia fruit juice was given @ 1.5 ml/bird/day to group 1 (morinda fed group) and group 2 was kept as control. The average adult body weight of male bird was highest in group 1 (1864Â±89.22 g) than in control (1748.5Â±83.22 g). The average FCR value was observed best in group 1 than in control group. The peak hen day egg production of 95.24% was achieved in group 1 while in the control group the peak production was observed in the 11 week with a value of 83.11%. Highest dressing % was obtained in the group 1 (69.05%) than in control (68.38%). The humoral immune response revealed the appearance of antibody in all the groups at first week of post immunizationof goat RBC. The in-vivo cell mediated immune response to PHA-P (phytohaemagglutinin) was observed more in the group 1 (2.8Â±0.02) than in control (1.37Â±0.18). Based on the finding of the present study it is concluded that feeding of Morinda citrifolia @ 1.5 ml/bird /day enhanced growth, production and immune response in Nicobari fowl.",
