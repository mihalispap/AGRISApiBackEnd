	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Spraying of urea solution (0.1g/ml) in water to wheat straw at a concentration of 40 g/kg resulted in two-fold increase in protein content of straw. Feeding of urea-treated straw to camels significantly increased weight gain compared to camels fed on straw only. Lack of adverse effect of feeding urea on liver, heart and muscle-specific enzymes suggested that feeding urea at this concentration could be tolerated."}
