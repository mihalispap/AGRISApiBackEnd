	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Complementary diets were prepared from vegetable proteins. The grains (maize, rice and cowpea) were germinated. The blend was formulated and studied for viscosity, bulk density, swelling and water holding capacity. The germination period was 72 h for maize and rice and 48 h for cowpea. The germinated diet indicated significant (P<0.005) reduction in the paste viscosity from over 10,000 cps to about 3,000 cps at 10% matter."}
