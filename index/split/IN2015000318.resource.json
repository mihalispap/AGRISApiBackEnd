The AFC calculated in this study was 38.73Â±0.73 months. The overall mean lactation milk yield based on first 5 lactations was 779.27Â±18.31 kg with an average lactation length of 186.31Â±3.02 days. The present study also revealed that there was a significant increase in milk yield in second lactation than first lactation. The overall dry period and calving interval were 256.87Â±7.34 and 447.22Â±6.64 days, respectively. The overall mortality rate in Deoni cattle recorded was 2.17%. In view of reasonably better productive and reproductive performances in the present investigation than earlier studies there is a scope for further genetic improvement of the present Deoni herd.",
