		{"value":"Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in surface soils of central agricultural areas were investigated to evaluate the environmental quality of these potentially toxic elements using 603 samples. The following average concentrations were obtained: Cu, 21.8 mg/kg",

	{"value":"Hg, 0.047 mg/kg"},
	{"value":"Cd, 0.194 mg/kg"},
	{"value":"Zn, 63.7 mg/kg. Correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the results and identifying the possible sources of these potentially toxic elements. Distribution maps of the elements were created using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method. The nine metals exhibited generally distinct geographical patterns. Results showed that 6,730 km2 of the study area presented higher pollution indices and was slightly polluted."}
