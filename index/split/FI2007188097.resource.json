	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The bacteriological quality and residual chlorine level of water from all functional coolers at various venues of a university community were determined. Of a total of 73 coolers tested, 51 (69.9%) water samples had residual chlorine level of less than 0.4 ppm while 28 (38.4%), 12 (16.4%) and 5 (6.8%) were positive for aerobic bacteria, total coliforms and Escherichia coli respectively. For 22 water samples with residual chlorine level of >0.4 ppm, 9 (40.9%) were positive for aerobic bacteria but all were negative for total coliforms and E. coli. However, the prevalence of aerobic bacteria, total coliforms and E. coli in 51 cooler-water samples with residual chlorine level less than 0.4 ppm was 19 (37.3%), 12 (23.5%) and 5 (9.8%) respectively. The fact that 16.4% of cooler water samples were considered unfit for human consumption having exceeded the zero tolerance for coliforms in drinking water, could have health implications to consumers."}
