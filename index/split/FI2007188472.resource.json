	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Researchers have encountered difficulties in extracting proteins from olive leaves because of the high content of interfering compounds in this tissue. Recently, after testing several methods, a phenol-SDS method was devised to extract proteins from olive leaves for proteomic studies. This method is tricky and the use of phenol, a very corrosive agent, requires careful handling. We therefore tested the phenol-SDS method along with a slightly modified standard method that gave equal, or better, results on two dimensional electrophoresis gels. This simpler and more convenient method of protein extraction from olive leaves is described here."}
