	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The polyphenol composition of a range of Ontario icewines and late harvest wines was quantified. For 1999-2000 experimental wines, the FAUX icewines (harvested above -8°C and before 18 December) had high concentrations of hydroxycinnamates (10 to 37 mg/L in Riesling; 53 to 82 mg/L in Vidal) which dropped to concentrations below 10 mg/L for the REAL icewines (harvested at temperatures -8°C or below and after 28 December). However, in 2002 experimental icewines, high concentrations of hydroxycinnamates were seen in both REAL and FAUX wines (40 to 84 mg/L in Riesling; 106 to 129 mg/L in Vidal), but all of the grapes were harvested before 11 December. Low to moderate concentrations of total hydroxycinnamates were observed in commercial icewines (10 to 40 mg/L) and late harvest wines (5 to 60 mg/L). Freeze concentration during icewine making appears to have substantial impact upon polyphenol composition and concentration, but time of harvest and growing season appear to be equally important."}
