	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Development of wheat cultivars to stress tolerant is one objective of breeding efforts in Jordan. Twenty-four spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars introduced from the International Center of Agricultural Research at Dry Area (ICARDA) were evaluated for drought tolerance. The agronomic performance, grain yield and yield components of these cultivars were compared in a field study that carried out during the seasons of 2002 and 2003 in the research station of the Faculty of Agricultural Technology at Humrat Al-Sahen, representing the semi-arid condition in Jordan. The study revealed that four genotypes (Attila-6, Cham-4, Haama-2, and Booma-1) produced high yield comparing to local check cultivar (Hourani Nawawi). The main reason for the higher yield was the higher seed/spike. These genotypes could be used as plant material in the further studies for producing drought tolerant wheat cultivars in Jordan."}
