Interaction effect of bait additives and crop stage revealed highest bait consumption in groundnut oil + broken rice at panicle initiation stage (14.44 &14.88 g/day) followed by groundnut oil + broken maize at panicle initiation stage (13.33 &13.99 g/day) of both boro and sali rice, respectively.",
