	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Bark powder of Albizia spp. (A. myriophylla and A. kalkora) is used in the preparation of Khai or Hamei, a starter for the fermentation of rice slurry in preparing Zou or Yu â€“ a fermented alcoholic beverage. From the hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed Albizia bark powder 12 phenolic acids were qualitatively isolated viz. gallic acid, gentisic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, salicylic acid, quercetin, eugenol and kaempferol. The ethanol yield was quantified by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) assay methods. Ethanol yield from Hamei prepared by phenolic acids substituting Albizia bark powder was found to be maximum in acid mixture (76.32%) and minimum in 2% ferulic acid (51.17%). Phenolic acids role in the quality control of Hamei, will be responsible for the quality and quantity of Zou preparation."}
