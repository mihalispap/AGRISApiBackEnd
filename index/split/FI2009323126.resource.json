	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Fusarium graminearum and Alternaria alternata are important fungal pathogens and mycotoxin producers. They occur already on wheat plants in the field, and, therefore, compete for the same resources. Competitive interaction experiments with different strains of F. graminearum (including a mutant, which is not able to produce trichothecenes) were performed in liquid cultures in vitro in a quantitative way and the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) were determined. A. alternata was clearly suppressed when growing together with F. graminearum. A reduction of DON productivity was observed in the mixed in vitro cultures compared with axenic cultures of F. graminearum whereas ZEA increased indicating that ZEA might play a role in competitive interactions between F. graminearum and A. alternata."}
