	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Two onion varieties Poona Red and Bellary Red were selected for the study. The onion variety Poona Red had higher total solids (13.2o Brix) and dry matter content (112.7 g kg-1) and lower dehydration ratio (8.87:1) and reducing sugars to non-reducing sugars ratio (0.512), which resulted in higher yield and very less browning discoloration of dehydrated product as compared to Bellary Red. Onion rings pre-treated with potassium metabisulphite (KMS) @ 2.5 g kg-1 were found best for the dehydration and have significant differences in the retention of moisture, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars, ascorbic acid and acidity during storage. They also exhibited significant difference in their rehydration ratios and overall acceptability."}
