	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Jute (Corchorus capsularis L.), the source of golden fibre is one of the major crops grown in eastern India, especially in the state of West Bengal. A field experiment was conducted at the University farm, Coochbehar (26°19′N, 89°23′E and 43 m above mean sea level), on an acid Entisol in the humid tropical tarai agroclimatic zone of West Bengal with Jute (cv. JRC 321) to study the direct effect of FYM, lime and magnesium sulphate along with recommended doses of NPK fertilizers application on the fibre yield and their residual effect on nutrient availability in the soil. There were increase in CEC and exchangeable Ca and Mg content of the soil and the availability of residual NPK due to application of FYM. Incorporation of lime and magnesium sulphate alone or in combination decreased the exchange as well as pH dependent acidity through increasing high base saturation while lowering the exchangeable Al3+ to nil. The available NPK increased significantly with liming. Jute crop responded significantly in terms of yield, and the highest yield was observed with the application of FYM, which was at par with lime treated plots followed by magnesium sulphate in combination with lime, and magnesium sulphate alone."}
