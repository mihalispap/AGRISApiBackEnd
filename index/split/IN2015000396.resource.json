The least squares means for heart girth, body length and height at withers at 3, 6 and 9 months of age were 47.69Â±0.18, 55.35Â±1.18, 59.06Â±0.21cm; 42.63Â±0.17, 49.30Â±0.17, 53.40Â±0.23 cm and 48.13Â±0.20, 56.01Â±0.21, 60.34Â±0.21 cm, respectively. Cluster of villages and sex had significant (P0.01) effect on body weights and height at withers at 3, 6 and 9 months, on body length at 3 and 9 months and on heart girth at 3 and 6 month of age. Year and season of birth showed significant (P0.05) effect on body weights at 9 and 6 months of age. Year of birth had significant (P0.05) effect on body length at 6 months and on height at withers at 6 and 9 months of age. Sex had significant (P0.01) effect on height at withers at 3 and 6 months of age.",
