Amongthe botanical insecticides, neem oil 1% gave highest CBR 1:2.59 and yield 80.43 q/ha, so neem oil 1% was found best botanical treatment against Earias vittella as it is eco-friendly, no residual effect and not caused hazardous effect to environment, also it could be an important tool in IPM programme.",
