	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A total of 36 ram testicles were collected from two local slaughter houses in Srinagar city and divided into four groups as per the post-mortem time. All the testicles were transported in normal saline and processed between 1â5 hrs (Gr I), between 6â10 hrs (Gr II), between 11â15 hrs (Gr III) and between 16â20 hrs (Gr IV) after slaughter. The mean testicular weights for group I, II, III and IV were 155.9Â±21.4, 174.5Â±13.3, 149.4Â±11.7 and 166.8Â±23.1 g, respectively and the corresponding values for cauda weight were 6.90Â±1.01, 9.13Â±0.70, 8.18Â±0.60 and 7.86Â±0.90 g. Sperm motility declined significantly from Gr I (85.0%) to Gr IV (70.56%). The sperm motility was significantly (P0.01) higher for Gr I than the other three groups. However, the difference was non-significant between Gr I and II and between Gr II and III. The mean live sperms were 92.5, 89.5, 89.67 and 83.28% for Gr I, II, III and IV, respectively. The mean intact acrosome percent also did not differ significantly between the four groups. The minor sperm abnormality percent increased non-significantly from Gr I to IV and was mainly contributed by distal cytoplasmic droplet which is considered as a normal part of sperm maturation process. Also the major sperm abnormality did not show any definite trend from Gr I to IV. In conclusion, the quality of ram cauda epididymal spermatozoa did not deteriorate even at 20 hrs after slaughter.",
