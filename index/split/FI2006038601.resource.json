	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The effects of genotypes and growth regulators on anther culture response were investigated using two wheat and five barley cultivars. Two separate experiments were conducted. In the first one, barley genotypes significantly affected anther response and callus production; callus induction frequency was (1.25%, 3.30%, 2.25%, 3.60% and 1.00 %) for cultivars (B1, Rum, B5, B8 and B9) respectively. In the second one, medium containing 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) produced more calli and green plantlets than medium containing NAA (naphthalic acetic acid) from wheat cultivars (Acsad 65, and Hourani Nawawi). The wheat plantlets that reached maturity are fertile, healthy and could be useful as plant material for breeding program."}
