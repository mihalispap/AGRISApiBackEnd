	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Addition of oils increases the infectivity of entomopathogens by enhancing conidial adhension, prolonged persistence and infectivity against the target pests. An in vitro study, by following the poison food technique was conducted to determine the compatibility of plant oils and adhesive stickers in enhancing the infectivity of Paecilomyces farinosus, a potential entomopathogenic fungi. The compatibility of seven plant oils viz; coconut, groundnut, gingili, sunflower, neem, pongamia and castor oil and two adhesive stickers (Laboline and Triton X 100) with P. farinosus was investigated by measuring the radial growth of fungus at 5th, 10th and 15th day and the conidial spore yield of inoculation. The compatibility of the fungi to the oils and stickers studied varied. Among the oils and adhesives screened, groundnut, pongamia, gingili and castor oil and Triton X 100 were non-compatible with the fungus. Addition of sunflower, coconut and neem oil and Laboline enhanced the mycelia growth and sporulation of the fungus. Adding these oils and sticker with the fungi could increase their effectiveness as a bio-pesticide against the target pests."}
