Among the individual management modules, carbofuran @ 1.5 kg a.i / ha was the effective management module which enhanced plant growth, yield and reduced disease development. Although significant increase in growth, yield and disease development was recorded in T9 (Bacillus subtilis @ 5 lit / ha + soil solarization), T10 (crustacean exoskeleton @ 0.75 t / ha + soil solarization), T11 (carbofuran @ 0.75 kg a.i / ha + B. subtilis @ 5 lit / ha) and T12 (sesame oil cake @ 0.75 t / ha + soil solarization), T11 was found to be the most important cost effective management module with a B : C ratio of 2.8 : 1.",
