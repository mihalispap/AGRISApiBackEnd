	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The study examined the performance and evaluation of a 10 kW two wheel tractor (power tiller) and determined the cost of using power tiller in sawah rice production technology in Nigeria. The study was carried out in Bida area, Niger state, where the sawah rice production was disseminated by Watershed Initiative in Nigeria (WIN 2001). Some of the parameters assessed during the field test included average speed of operation, average wheel slip/travel reduction, average draught of implement and fuel consumption. Field efficiencies determined were 93 and 92% at Eject and Shaba-Maliki respectively. Assessment of soil parameters before and after the operation showed that the power tiller with the attached tillage tool had improved the soil structure. The cost of operation over five years of usage was determined and it was therefore concluded that the power tiller is a better alternative to animal drawn equipment for small-scale farmers."}
