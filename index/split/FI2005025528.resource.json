	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The epidemiology of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis among female patients in government hospitals in Ondo State was investigated. The state was zoned into Akure, Ikare, Okitipupa and Ondo zones. High vaginal swab (HVS) samples were collected from the State Specialist Hospital in each zone. A total of 650 samples was examined within two months. Investigations revealed that incidence of candidiasis among female patients was 83%. Candida albicans accounted for 81.5% of the infections while other species of Candida accounted for 18.5%. Ikare has the highest incidence while Okitipupa had the lowest. The infection showed no age discrimination as it occurred in all the age groups tested."}
