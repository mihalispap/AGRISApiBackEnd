	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Dextrins resulting from roasting of potato starch with one of alanine (ALA), glutamic acid (GLUA), glycine (GLC), histidine (HIS), phenylalanine (PHE), proline (PRO), and tryptophane (TRP) were tested for their potential prebiotic properties. Thus, they were digested by α-amylase and tested as a nutrient for Lactobacillus liquefaciens and Bifidobacterium. Both tests indicate that majority of tested dextrins might be useful as prebiotics as a dietary fiber or slowly digestible starch derivatives."}
