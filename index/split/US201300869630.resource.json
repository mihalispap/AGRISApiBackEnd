	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A study was undertaken to measure the effects of Alar (acid succinamic 2,2-dimethylhydrazine) on the growth characteristics of 11 apple rootstock selections bred in Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Horticultural Research and Development Centre in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. These released rootstocks are very hardy but some exhibit auxiliary thorns on their stems especially at juvenile stage that can hinder commercial rootstock production. The application of Alar at concentrations of 500 ppm or 1000 ppm six weeks after full bloom reduced the average number of thorns over all by 29.0 to 16.2% respectively. Alar also reduced secondary growth at the grafting area and the average height of the rootstock but it did not significantly affect root development or diameter at the grafting zone. Tested rootstocks responded differently to Alar application and thorn reduction was especially pronounced on two extremely-dwarfing (SJM118 and SJM180), three very dwarfing (SJM15, SJM44 and SJM188) and one dwarfing selection (SJM189). A reduction of 65% was noted for the SJM118 following the 500 ppm Alar application."}
