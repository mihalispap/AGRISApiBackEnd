	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The domestic and external demand for Indian small ruminant meat is high and is posed to register further growth. It is highly preferred in export markets due to lean meat and organic nature of production. India has achieved impressive strides in export front over the period. In this backdrop, the present study analyses the trend in production and export of small ruminant meat and the prospects of boosting it. Small ruminant population has increased considerably between 2003 and 2007 censuses - with mixed results across the states and marked increase in southern parts of the country. However, the export of the small ruminant meat has grown faster than the population growth to the extent that the incremental export was over and above the incremental production. Indian meat export has undergone structural changes- from products with bone to boneless. It was associated with geographical diversification also- away from Saudi Arabia and UAE to a large number of other major countries. It was also observed that meat production is competitive at breeder level compared to other major producers. The study calls for further deepening of the competitive edge by organized institutional efforts so as to meet the increased demand.",
