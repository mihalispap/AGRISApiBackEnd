	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The study highlights the salient agricultural production practices that impact on the environment in the savannas of northern Nigeria. Due to population pressure on land and the need to maintain household food supplies farmers have increased their land-use intensity and natural resourcesnextraction practices that degrade the environment. Some agricultural production practices were, however, found to be environmental friendly. The study recommends remedial measures that have to be taken to avert agricultural production practices that predispose farmers to practices and extractive activities that undermine the environment."}
