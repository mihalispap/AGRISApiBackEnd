	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Eight male Mahabubnagar goats were slaughtered to study the meat production potential and carcass traits. The dressing percentages based on pre-slaughter weight and empty body weight were 44.60 Â± 0.95 and 59.74 Â± 1.07, while the average pre-slaughter weight, empty body weight and hot carcass weights were 24.36 Â± 1.00, 18.29 Â± 1.09 and 10.90 Â± 0.60 kg respectively. The mean edible and inedible organs weight were 0.81 Â± 0.02 and 6.97Â±0.25 kg respectively. The mean weight of primal cuts of carcass i.e., leg, loin, rack, neck and shoulder, breast and fore shank were 3.75 Â± 0.28, 1.10 Â± 0.04, 0.97 Â± 0.05, and 2.91 Â± 0.17 and 2.21 Â± 0.12 kg respectively. High proportion of meat in neck and shoulder (70.97%), bone in rack (37.33%) and fat in loin (5.71%) regions of primal cuts were noticed. The pre-slaughter weight and dressing percentages were correlated positively and significantly with all the primal cuts except loin. The pre-slaughter weight significantly contributed to the prediction of total edible organs, total inedible organs and different primal cuts.",
