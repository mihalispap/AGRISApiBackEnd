	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Cassava is the principal food for poor people in the tropics. India leads the world by productivity of 26 t/ha. Cassava reproduces by cuttings which accumulates pathogens. Apomixis represents an alternation to avoid this contamination. Apomixis was discovered in the wild cassava and transferred successfully to the cultivate one. Wild cassava relatives offered sources for its improvement for tolerance to bacteria blight and mosaic. More than 2 million hectares in Nigeria are now planted by cultivars stem from cassava hybrids with Manihot glaziovii. The species is potential too for breeding cultivars tolerant to mealy bug and offers the safest way to control this pest if the artificial ecosystem of biological control has broken down. Cassava diversity in unmanaged ecosystems is affected highly by both environment and human pressures."}
