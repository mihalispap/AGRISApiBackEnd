The lambs developed subclinical forms of Haemonchus infection as they remained alert. The lambs maintained a steady growth rate, PCV values within the normal range, egg voidance tended to increase in all lambs proportional to dose of infective larvae and showed no significant (P>0.5) differences between the three breeds."}
