	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"In this work a study of one-sided and double sided UV-C treatments on chilling injury and chlorophyll degradation of green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Helda) was conducted. In this way green beans kept better in one-sided UV-C treatments, maintaining bright green color and good texture. Nevertheless treatments of double-sided UV-C, especially higher doses, induced chilling injury because of the cell damage of pods as measured by electrolyte leakage during 14 days of storage. UV-C treatments produced different changes on the green beans chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content. Green beans of DS-3 and DS-5 showed a continuous degradation of chlorophyll b during the storage while the other samples showed decrease at the first 7 days and then increase. However, chlorophyll a and b remained best in pods treated with double-sided UV-C. Visual quality scores of pods in double-sided UV-C treatments were lower than those of one-sided UV-C treatments."}
