	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Technological feasibility to obtain gluten-free couscous based on rice-leguminous supplementation was studied. Cereal-leguminous of 2/1 weight/weight ratio was chosen to supplement semolina of rice (Oryza sativa) with each of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) or proteaginous pea (Pisum arvense) or field bean (Vicia faba). A traditional procedure, widely held in Constantine region (North East of Algeria), was described and tested to approach manual manufacturing feasibility for the three formulae comparatively to a control couscous made with wheat semolina (Triticum durum vulgare). The three gluten-free products and the control one were compared on the basis of productivity, granulometry, swelling, disintegration level and structure. Feasibility was confirmed for the three formulae, and comparison of the obtained products in accordance with tasters preference placed the Rice-Field bean Couscous (RFC) as best after the Hard Wheat Couscous (HWC), followed by the Rice-Chickpea Couscous (RCC) and the Rice-Proteaginous pea Couscous RPC."}
