Significantly minimum weed population and weed dry weight recorded with the application of topstar @0.1 kg ha-1 followed by anilofos @ 0.5kg ha-1. Almost all the yield attributes were observed significantly higher with the application of topstar @0.1 kg ha-1 as compared to rest of the treatments. Weed management practices did not affect the test weight significantly. Highest grain and straw yield were recorded with the application of topstar @ 0.1 kg ha-1 followed by anilofos @ 0.5 kg ha-1 butachor @ 1.5kg ha-1, one hand weeding and weedy check, respectively.",
