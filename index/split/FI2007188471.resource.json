	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The influence of the vegetation and inter-organ and intra-organ stage on the solasodine content was investigated in four natural populations of Solanum sodomeum L. growing in Tunisia. The influence of cutting leaves during immature fruits on the level of the active compound and the effect of ripe fruit number per cym on the percentage of solasodine were studied. The solasodine content increased with the plant age and was higher in the leaves than in stems and roots. The solasodine content varied with the position of leaves, being highest in the basic leaves at full flowering and the beginning of fructification. The solasodine content decreased significantly in the ripe berries when leaves were cut during the immature fruit stage. The content in ripe fruits was highest when the cym consisted of 2-3 berries. The pericarp and the placentary tissues of ripe berries contained more solasodine than the seeds. The solasodine content depended on the geographical site of the four populations."}
