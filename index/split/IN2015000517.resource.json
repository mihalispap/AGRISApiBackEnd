Out of these, dimethoate @ 1ml lit-1 was found most compatible with Pochonia lecanii @ 108 CS ml-1 was significantly superior for aphid population decrease followed by dimethoate @ 1ml lit-1 followed by Coccinella septempunctata @ 5000 beetles ha-1 and it was recorded as 14.50 (85.5%), 10.65 (89.3%) and 4.35 (95.6%) aphids plant-1 at 3, 7 and 10 DAS, respectively. The highest increase yield (925.0 kg ha-1) was recorded from treated with dimethoate @ 1ml lit-1 followed by P. lecanii @ 108 CS ml-1 over the control, and the maximum cost benefit ratio (1:37.43) was recorded in dimethoate followed by Coccinella septempunctata.",
