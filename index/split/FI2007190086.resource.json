	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The integrated effect of intercropping, a synthetic pesticide (monocrotophos) (M) and neem based biopesticide (neem oil - 2%) (NO) on three groundnut defoliators damage and also the groundnut production was studied. The monocrotophos and neem oil combination was found to be very effective in reducing the defoliator infestation. Defoliatorâ€™s incidence was significantly higher in untreated plots, resulting in significantly lower yield (1539 kg ha-1). Application of monocrotophos and neem oil mixture increased the groundnut yield (2011 kg ha-1) compared to monocrotophos (1878 kg ha-1) and control categories. The estimated avoidable groundnut and black gram yield loss were lower in monocrotophos treatment."}
