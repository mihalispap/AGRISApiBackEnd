	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Cassava is presently one of the important commodities that constitute the new presidential initiatives for accelerated development of crop enterprises in Nigeria. The paper undertakes a constraints analysis of the marketing environment for cassava enterprises in the country with a view to recommending viable solutions to promote the enterprises. The key constraints identified include inappropriate technology of production and processing, poor access to credit, poor market infrastructure, among others. Thus cassava marketing can be promoted by developing entrepreneurial skills for good quality cassava products of high demand in international markets such as pellets, chips flour and starch; promoting local use for livestock feed and other agro-industries, mobilizing producer-processor integration in linkages to the arable crop development and marketing company; and improving access to inputs, market information and infrastructures. In addition effective supervision of cassava processing through the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDCAC) would promote good quality of cassava products consistent with the WHO standards for food quality and safety, so the international market for the products can be expanded in the ECOWAS sub-region, Europe and South East Asia."}
