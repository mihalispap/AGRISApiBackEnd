	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The proximate analysis, minerals and physico-chemical properties were determined on the powdered seed and oil extracted from the Cucurbita maxima seed (gourd seeds) using standard methods. The proximate composition (%) of the powdered seed was oil 52.13± 0.13, protein 14.31±0.10, moisture 3.08±0.09, ash 3.60±0.15, crude fibre 2.55±0.08 and carbohydrate 24.45±0.12. The mineral composition (ppm) of the seed was sodium 296.9, potassium 358.7, magnesium 348.7, calcium 294.7, phosphorus 2241.5, manganese 17.9, zinc 39.9, iron 42.7 while copper and cobalt were not detected. The physico-chemical properties of the seed oil extracted were saponification value 126.09±0.01, peroxide value 2.80±0.08, acid value 0.36±0.14, iodine value 18.66±0.02, specific gravity 0.94±0.06, refractive index 1.45±0.15 and free fatty acid 1.06±0.02. The seed has potential use as an industrial raw material."}
