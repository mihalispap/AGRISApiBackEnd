	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The agronomic characteristics of thirteen improved rice varieties were compared with farmersâ€™ own varieties, in two villages of South-Eastern Tanzania. The aim was to provide farmers with new varieties and to try out the idea of shortening the process of releasing new varieties. The variation between the varieties could be reduced to three principal component axes (PCA) representing 83% of the original variation in the first village and 76% in the second village. These PCA correspond to structural plant characteristics, grain characteristics and yield. The differences in structural characteristics and grain characteristics were statistically significant, while this was not the case for the differences in yield. Nevertheless, farmers were quick at selecting varieties with many tillers and high grain qualities. If the conventional procedure for releasing varieties would have been followed, it is unlikely that breeders would have retained these varieties. Making varieties, or promising lines, available to farmers at an early stage not only shortens the release process but also ensures that farmers get varieties suiting their needs."}
