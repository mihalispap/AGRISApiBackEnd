	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Stress of mechanical damage (cutting) caused metabolic changes of phenol compounds in carrot. The level of soluble phenolics and responsible for the bitter taste isocoumarin increased in the root slices obtained by the crosswise cutting and stored for three days at room temperature. These changes were accompanied by the increase in phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity, the key enzyme in phenylpropanoid synthesis. One of the responses to root injury was also stress ethylene evolution. The higher sensitivity to wounding stress was in most cases presented by the roots attacked previously by the carrot fly (Psila rosae). Mechanical damage of carrot roots during the growing period (pest feeding) as well as during harvesting, transportation and the initial processing can affect significantly biological and nutritional quality of carrot, particularly in case of inadequate storage and handling conditions."}
