	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"With the increasing urban building density, wind environment problems around the buildings become more and more serious. Wind environment not only affects human living comfort, but also closely relates to their security and health. So, it is important to study the wind environment to improve it in the building planning and design and it is also an important part of making a reasonable evaluation of wind environment in green building design. In the current study, wind tunnel test and numerical simulation of computer technology are considered as an effective means of simulation and validation of environment.",
