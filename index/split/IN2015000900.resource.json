	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Field trials were laid out to test the effectiveness of newer acaricide i.e. fenpyroximate (Pyromite) 5 EC against European red mite, Panonychus ulmi Koch, infesting apple in Harsil area of Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand. The experiment was conducted on 12-15 years old apple trees cv. Golden delicious under randomized block design with three replications. Various dosage viz. 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 2.0 ml/l of fenpyroximate were compared with conventional acaricides viz fenazaquin 10 EC (0.5 ml/l), sulfer (0.5 ml/l) and water spray against P. ulmi during 2010 and 2011. At highest dosage (2.0 ml/l), there was 83.88 and 85.67% reduction of mite population on first day after spray (DAS) which increased 97.33 and 98.33% on 10th DAS during 2010 and 2011, respectively. This was significantly superior with fenazaquin 10 EC (0.5 ml/l) and sulfer (0.5 ml/l) where 82.30 and 80.00; 82.30 and 78.60% reduction was recorded during two consecutive years, respectively. However, sulfur was found to be at par with fenazaquin. Significantly, highest yield (171.33 and 158.25 kg/tree) was recorded with highest dosage of fenpyroximate (2.0 ml/l) which was at par with lower dosage (1.0 ml/l) of fenpyroximate (170.25 and 155.25 kg/tree) (p 0.05 = 6.428 and 5.810) during two consecutive years. At 0.5 ml/l dosage, fenazaquin 10 EC (150.25 &143.75 kg/tree) proved to be at par with fenpyroximate (155.75 &148.25 kg/tree) (p 0.05= 6.4298 &5.810).",
