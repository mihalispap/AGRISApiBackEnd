Perusal of data revealed that the percentage of reduction in damage intensity levels were gradually increased when number of damaged internodes were increased except 8- damaged internodes which was even lower than those of 6-and 7-damaged internodes. This might be due to lesser number of effective larvae feeding on internodes at this damage intensity and/or physiological changes like better recoverability of damaged tissues at this growth stages",
