	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Effects of preharvest gibberellic acid treatments (10, 20 and 30 ppm) on ‘Aksehir Napolyon’ sweet cherry cultivar were compared with control during four weeks of storage. The most important problem of sweet cherry is discoloration of stem after storage. Different preharvest treatments can be effective to stop or slow down discoloration. Fruit firmness, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, stem color (1-3 scale), weight loss and fruit decay were evaluated based on different concentrations of GA3. Application of 10 ppm GA3 decreased the loss of fruit firmness, delayed stem discoloration and maintained the brightness during storage compared with control and the other application rates."}
