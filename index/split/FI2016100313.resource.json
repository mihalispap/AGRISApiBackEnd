	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Dried mophane worms (phane) are a common but small part of the diet in Botswana. Proximate analysis of phane showed it to be a very good food source, with high protein content (approximately 50%) and a significant amount of fat (approximately 15%). The traditional method of preparing phane, which is degutting, cooking, salting and drying, should produce a product suitable for long-term storage. Therefore, we explored several ways to use phane as a high protein food component, with a view to promote its use year round. The most promising of these was the addition of phane to weaning food. Sorghum was mixed with phane at a ratio of 80:20 to give a protein mixture of about 18%, and with ditloo, bambara nuts and phane at 40:40:20 (sorghum:ditloo:phane) to give a protein content of about 20%. In the case of weaning food, microbiological quality becomes especially important. It was found that phane purchased from street vendors in Botswana was contaminated with coliforms/faecal coliforms at levels that might be acceptable when the phane was to be cooked further, but unacceptable for infant food. Therefore, a post-processing method to reduce these organisms to acceptable levels was tested."}
