	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The purpose of this review article is to provide clear and brief information on the effects of fertigation, mulches, and CO2 enrichment on eggplant production. Fertigation has two major advantages (1) saving labor and expenses, and (2) provides the plants with more efficient and more effective chance of using the nutrients. Mulches used in home gardening or for commercial vegetable production, including eggplant, increase plant growth, hasten maturity and increase crop yields. A substantial increase in productivity of vegetable crops and fruit yields, including eggplants, was noted when plants were grown on soils covered with mulch. Increasing CO2 concentration has proven to increase crops, including eggplant, yields. In general, fertigation, mulch application, and CO2 enrichment substantially increase eggplant yields."}
