	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"In the present study, a PCR targeting 251 gene locus was developed for detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and applied on suspected and healthy tissue samples and the results were compared with microscopic examination of Ziehl Neelsen's (ZN) stained smears. Out of 15 suspected tissue samples, 13 (87%) and 12 (80%) were found positive by 251 gene locus PCR and smear examination, respectively. Both tests were found positive in 11 cases and negative in one case. Two cases were detected as positive by 251 gene locus PCR, which were negative for acid fast bacilli in ZN stained smears. The higher sensitivity of PCR assay in comparison to ZN method suggested that 251 gene locus PCR assay can be used as a rapid and confirmatory diagnostic tool for investigation of Johne's disease.",
