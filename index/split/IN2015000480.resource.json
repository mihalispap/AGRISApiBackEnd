The highest reduction in larval weight was observed in case of neem seed kernel extract while the highest reduction in larval period was observed in case of subza leaf extract. Relatively low larval mortlities were recorded in case of plant extracts. However, the larval mortality percentages observed in case of triazophos 40 EC at half recommended dose and neem seed kernel extract @ 5% were found statistically at par with each other.",
