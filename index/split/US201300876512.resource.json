	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), Glomus deserticola, on the growth of  Gliricidia sepium under P 0, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 levels of phosphorus fertilization. Inoculation with AMF increased dry matter yield at all levels of applied phosphorus in both sterile and non-sterile soils while P fertilization at 100 mg kg-1 soil level in conjunction with AMF inoculation increased the dry matter yield by 269.2 and 107.7% in sterile and non-sterile soils respectively. P fertilization increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization but decreased mycorrhizal dependency. Colonization by indigenous AMF was, however, significantly (p<0.01) reduced at P 100 mg kg-1 soil fertilization. Foliar N, P and K yields were significantly (p<0.01) increased by AMF inoculation."}
