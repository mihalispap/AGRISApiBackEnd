	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The physicochemical (pH, mechanical firmness and vitamin C) and sensory parameters of grafted and ungrafted melon plants were studied in relation to storage time (up to 21 days at 10°C). Melon seedlings of cultivar ‘Galia’ were grafted on commercial hybrids ‘Mamouth’ and ‘9075’ rootstocks to avoid the soil-borne disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis. The fruits were stored under modified atmosphere (30% CO2, 70% N2) at 10°C. Vitamin C was not affected by grafting and modified atmosphere but decreased during storage. pH was not affected neither by grafting nor by MAP. Flesh firmness decreased during storage but was not considerably affected by grafting or modified atmosphere. Sensory analysis did not reveal any statistical differences between fruits from grafted and ungrafted plants. Fruit quality decreased during storage, but modified atmosphere helped in better maintaining of the fruits in comparison with air."}
