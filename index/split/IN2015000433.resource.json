	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Reproductive performances were studied in goat following synchronization of oestrus with progesterone-impregnated vaginal sponge plus PMSG and HCG. Five Assam goats, 2-3 years of age, at about 45 days post-parturition, reared under semi-intensive were treated with progesterone impregnated vaginal sponges kept in situ for 9 days. On the day of sponge removal PMSG was injected intramuscularly @ 300 LV. per animal and also injected HCG intravenously at 6 hr post oestrus @ 500 LV. The A.L was done with Beetal buck semen at 24 and 36 hr post onset of oestrus. Five other Assam goats of similar age, reproductive status and rearing condition served as control. All the experimental goats exhibited oestrus following treatment and the mean interval between end of PMSG treatment and onset of oestrus was 34.40 Â± 4.16 hr, where as the control animals exhibited oestrus at a mean interval of 68.80 Â± 6.71 days after last kidding. The duration of oestrus was recorded to be longer in treated group (40.00 Â± 4.60 hr) than in control goats (36.40 Â± 3.12 hr), however, the difference was not significant between the groups. The mean body weight of male and female kids born was 0.90 Â± 0.04 and 0.71 Â± 0.05 kg and 1.00 Â± 0.04 and 0.86 Â± 0.24 kg in treated and control group, respectively. A total of 12 and 9 kids were born from 5 does each of treated and control group. The sex ratio was 1:1 and 1.25:1 in treated and control group, respectively. It was concluded that progesterone-impregnated vaginal sponge was effective to induce pronounced synchronized oestrus in Assam goats and to increase the litter size by 33.33 per cent.",
