	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"This study ascertained the constraints to small-scale fish farming in Delta State of Nigeria. Data were obtained through questionnaire, personal interview and observations from 75 respondents. Descriptive statistics and chi-square test were used to analyse the data. The constraints to fish farming in Delta State included poaching, high cost of inputs, lack of credit facilities, inadequate extension services, pollution, high cost of equipment and ecological problems like overflooding. The innovations adopted mostly by the respondents included fish breeding technique, feed formulation technique, fast growing exotic/hybrids and ecological disaster management/prevention. Others were pollution management, smoking equipment and brood stock selection technique. The chi-square analysis showed that a significant relationship exists between innovation adoption and the constraints to fish farming but did not show that the years of experience of the farmers have significant relationship with the constraints. The study recommended among others that the smallâ€“scale farmers should be encouraged and guided to form a cooperative society."}
