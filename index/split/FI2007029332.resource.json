	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Waste management in Zaria metropolis remains a problem that needs to be addressed since waste food packaging materials are seen littered indiscriminately in Zaria metropolis. The study therefore sought to identify waste disposal methods as well as management options for handling waste food packaging materials to ensure environmental health and beauty. This study was conducted in Zaria area, using questionnaire method to obtain data. Results indicate that waste food packaging materials are commonly discarded using waste bins and public refuse dumps. Management options recommended include that the public should be educated through enlightenment campaigns organized by the Ministry of Environment, on the need and implications of indiscriminate dumping of waste food packaging materials. Curriculum planners should also include appropriate methods of waste disposal in school curricular from primary to tertiary institutions."}
