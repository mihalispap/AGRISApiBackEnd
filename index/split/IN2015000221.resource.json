The Cry 1 Ac toxin expression was found to be variable among the hybrids and also among the different plant parts over the plant age. The Cry 1 Ac toxin expression was highest in leaves followed by inter locular wall and seed when compared to flower buds, flowers and boll rind in both MECH 12 Bt and RCH 2 Bt hybrids. The toxin expression was highest at 60 DAS which declined gradually by 150 DAS in both MECH 12 Bt and RCH 2 Bt hybrids.",
