	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Silor) were treated with UV-A light and stored at both 5 and 10oC for 15 days. The UV-A treatments reduced yellowing and senescence of cucumbers during the storage at 10oC. Green colour was maintained best in cucumbers treated with UV-A for 30-min. However, the UV-A treatment had no effect on the color of cucumbers stored at 5oC. UV-A-treated cucumbers also kept firmer at 10oC, but at 5oC only cucumbers treated for 5- and 10-min. UV-A treatments affected flesh firmness. Total soluble solids and weight loss of UV-A-treated cucumbers were high both at 5 and 10oC, but UV-A treatments had did not reduce chilling injury symptoms as measured by electrolyte leakage."}
