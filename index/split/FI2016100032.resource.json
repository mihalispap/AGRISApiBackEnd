	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Properties of λ-carrageenan complexes with paramagnetic transition metal cations [Co (II), Cu (II), Fe(III), Mn (II),and Ni (II)] were evaluated using the EPR spectrometry, conductivity measurements, thermogravimetric (TG), and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies as well as computations with involvement of the ZINDO-1 method. The formation of the Werner-type complexes with metal central atom and polysaccharide as the ligand was proven. Ligation of the central atom involved lone electron pairs of the polysaccharide hydroxyl groups and the SO3- groups of carrageenan."}
