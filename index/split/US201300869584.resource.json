	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Phytochemicals are extensively found at different levels in many medicinal plants. The aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of three thymus species (T. vulgaris Jo 276, T. boveii Jo 856 and T. broussonetii) against six pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichiacoli, Enterobacter sp., Candida albicans and Candida albicans (WHO)) and to determine the genetic variation among the thymus species. T. vulgaris, T. boveii and T. broussonetii inhibited the growth of all six microorganisms at all used extract amounts (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/ml). Based on variation of RAPD patterns obtained with three primers (OPB1, OPB5 and OPB7), the similarity among Thymus spp. was determined. The UPGMA-based (unweighted pair group method of arithmetic means) dendrogram constructed between the three species depends on the similarity matrix results. T. vulgaris and T. boveii showed closer genetic relationship than T. broussonetii, they also showed higher antimicrobial activity on most microorganisms tested."}
