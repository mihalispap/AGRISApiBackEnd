	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Fagara zanthoxyloides was screened for biologically active ingredients and its antifungal activities. The results revealed that the plant extract possessed the following active ingredients: alkaloids, saponins, tannins and glycosides. The extract exerted inhibitory effect on Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the extract ranged between 20 and 70%  (w/v), while the minimum fungicidal concentration ranged between 30 and 80% (w/v). The results obtained suggest that this medicinal plant could  be useful as an anti-fungal agent."}
