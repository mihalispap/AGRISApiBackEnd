The maximum larvae of Plutella xylostella were noted in 50th SW during both the years at temperature range of 11.0-25.9oC and RH 64.4% in 2009-2010 and 7.3-24.0oC and RH 68.9% in 2010-2011. Pieris brassicae reached to its maximum in 5th SW at temperature range of 7.1-24.9oC and RH 64.7% during 2009-2010 and 6.0-23.7oC and 70.5% RH with a population range of 0.33-2.58/10 plants during 2010- 2011. Maximum population of Thysanoplusia orichalcea was recorded at which maximum temperature was 25.4oC and RH was 72.9%. All insect pests had negative correlation with minimum and maximum temperatures during both the years.",
