	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A total of 47 seminal fluids from men with fertility problems were investigated during the period of study (October, 2003 â€“ February, 2004). The seminal fluids were processed for semen analysis, culture and sensitivity. Semen analysis results showed that 22 samples (46.8%) had low sperm count (less than 20 million cells/ml), 4 (8.5%) borderline count, 11 (23.4%) moderate oligospermia (1-20 million sperm cells/ml), 3 (6.4%) severe oligospermia (less than 1 million sperm cells/ml) and 7 (14.9%) azoospermia (no sperm cells in the seminal fluid). Thirty-four (72.1%) of the semen specimens collected yielded growth of bacteria. The isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (61.8%), Escherichia coli (14.7%), Klebsiella spp. (11.7%) and Proteus spp. (11.7%). The bacterial isolates were collectively sensitive to rocephin (100%) and peflacin (100%) irrespective of the organism. For the isolated S. aureus, the least effective antibiotics were ampicillin (10%) and penicillin (10%), for E. coli ampicillin (20%), for Klebsiella spp. and Proteusspp. chloramphenicol (25%) and streptomycin (25%) respectively."}
