	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Although the local weather conditions are harsh, Kuwait has a unique desert ecosystem. However, many of Kuwait’s native plants are threatened, endangered or difficult to germinate in extreme weather conditions. Native plants are the main constituent of the biological diversity. They are also highly adapted to the local environmental and climatic conditions. Therefore, native plant conservation can restore the vegetation cover in Kuwait’s desert. A study was executed in Kuwait’s desert to develop the appropriate plant palette, to provide selected native and acclimatized plants to enhance the microclimate and periodically assess the status of native flora and fauna at the site. Approximately 2240 acclimatized native and naturalized plants and mangrove seedlings in addition to a desert-seed mix were used for planting at the project site. The growth and development of these plants were monitored routinely, and the initial results were encouraging. Soil and water samples were routinely collected and analyzed for various parameters. The results suggest that the micro-climate of the site has been improved with the agricultural activities occurring at the site, where 12 native plant species and 35 native and migratory birds were observed at the time of the project termination."}
