	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The activity of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) in the chloroplasts of leaves of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) was followed during the growth and development of the plants and following exposure to cold stress. The levels of activity showed very great variability in the leaves of a given plant, the youngest leaves had the highest activity and mature leaves generally the lowest. Different cultivars of basil differed in the level of activity of their PPO and this level changed during development and with the season of the year. Levels of activity and sensitivity of different cultivars to stress were not correlated. Total phenolics showed no clear correlation with sensitivity to cold. The implications of these findings on reports on correlations between levels of PPO activity in plants and their responses to environmental stress are discussed. The great variability of PPO activity within a plant and during its growth and development must always be taken into account. Simple sampling techniques can result in seriously flawed conclusions about correlations."}
