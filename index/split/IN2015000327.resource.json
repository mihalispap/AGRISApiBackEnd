The wall of uterus was consisted of endometrium, myometrium and perimetrium. The endometrium was lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium. It was folded, the height of epithelium and folds increased in all the 3 region of the uterus (horn, body and cervix) from group A to C. Enodometrial branching of the folds was maximum in cervix region of the uterus. The glands were distributed in superficial and deep zones and their density was maximum in deeper zone. Caruncular area of the endometrium was devoid of gland.",
