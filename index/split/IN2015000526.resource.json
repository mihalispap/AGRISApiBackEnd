	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Effect of soil types on wilt incidence revealed maximum incidence of 74.7% in loam soil and least in clay soil (49.5%). Similarly soil pH on disease indicated maximum wilt incidence (51.5%) at soil pH 5 followed by pH 7. Correlation coefficient between wilt incidence and pH of the soil indicated that incidence was negatively (-0.960*) and significantly correlated with soil pH. Significantly maximum population of F. udum (4.83 x 103 cfu/g soil) was recorded in 1st July and 16th July sowing at upper (0-15) soil strata followed by the subsequent date of sowing on same depth of soil strata. At crop harvest stage, maximum population of F. udum 15.17 x 103 cfu/g soil in 1st July sowing at upper soil strata (0-15 cm). The minimum population of F. udum was recorded in 16th August sowing at 31-45 cm soil strata. Sowing of pigeon pea in first fortnight recorded maximum wilt incidence 89.5 % in 1st July sowing which was on par with 16th July sowing (86.8 %) and significantly higher than August sowing.",
