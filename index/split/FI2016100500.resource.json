	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Adoption and continued use of any new technology is a dynamic process which will change over time and may be influenced by a wide range of factors such as changes in funding, administration, linkage system and delivery system will reflect in the sustained use of technologies. A multi-stage random sampling process was used to select one hundred and eighty farmers representing ten percent of the farmers. 72.2% were high adopters while the remaining 27.8% were in the low adopter category. For maize and cassava, fertilizer use and fertilizer application have the least adoption rate 75.6% and 30.6% respectively. For cowpea planting distance, storage practices, seed dressing, and spraying and for yam the use of improved varieties, seed/sett dressing had the lowest adoption rate. In the total continued use of the technologies tested about 16 percent have a score 1- 24 and they are regarded as low continued users. 34.3% of the respondents still using 25-36 of the adopted technologies they classified as medium continued user. High continued user are those farmers that are still using 37-48 (49.4%) of the tested technologies."}
