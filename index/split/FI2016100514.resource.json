	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Precipitation is the major water source for agricultural production in the semiarid region of China. Limited and erratic precipitation often results in low crop yields and sometimes in total crop failure. In recent years, rainwater harvesting was promoted to solve water problem for agricultural and domestic uses. Implementation of rainwater harvesting has been successfully solved drinking water problem, and is being adopted to improve crop production and promoted to adjust agricultural structure to increase farm's income and improve living environment. Rainwater harvesting has great potential to achieve sustainable agriculture in semiarid regions."}
