	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The effects of different levels of three antioxidants viz., reduced glutathione (3, 5, 7 and 9 mM), ascorbic acid (3, 5, 7, 9 and 10mM), Â¨Â¢-tocopherol (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 mM) were evaluated individually on initial, post-equilibration and post-thaw progressive motility in Sirohi buck semen. Ten ejaculates having the volume Â¡Ã 0.5 ml, mass motility Â¡Ã +3.0 and the initial progressive motility Â¡Ã 60.00% were processed for freezing for each antioxidant fortification. The addition of all three additives improved the mean per cent initial, post-equilibration and post-thaw progressive motility of spermatozoa. The-post thaw progressive motility for 0, 3, 5, 7 and 9 mM concentration of reduced glutathione was recorded as 26.50, 24.90, 28.50, 32.00 and 28.80%, respectively. Similarly, the post-thaw progressive motility on addition of ascorbic acid at 0, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10 mM level was 23.60, 25.00, 26.60, 30.40, 37.00 and 36.90%, respectively. The post-thaw progressive motility at 0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 mM level of Â¨Â¢-tocopherol was 23.10, 26.20, 26.70, 32.00, 37.00 and 26.70%, respectively. The results indicated that individual antioxidant levels of 7 mM reduced glutathione, 9 mM ascorbic acid and 4.5 mM Â¨Â¢tocopherol showed higher post-thaw progressive motility of Sirohi buck semen compared to other levels studied.",
