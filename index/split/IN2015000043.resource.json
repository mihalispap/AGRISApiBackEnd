	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The evaluation of field efficacy, economics and persistent toxicity of insecticides against Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee on brinjal were carried out during 2007 and 2008 at Palampur. Field efficacy showed that among the tested insecticides, the mean fruit infestation was minimum (18.79%) in emamectin benzoate followed by agrospray oil T (21.94%) and endosulfan (22.72%). On the basis of cost of protection, agrospray oil T showed highest (1:73.13) cost benefit ratio followed by lambda-cyhalothrin (1:44.41) and endosulfan (1:44.36). The highest (302.08) persistent toxicity value against neonate larvae was observed in emamectin benzoate followed by spinosad (264.58) and endosulfan (210.42). It was concluded that L. orbonalis can be effectively managed by the application of emamectin benzoate (0.002%) followed by agrospray oil T (0.02%) and endosulfan (0.05%).",
