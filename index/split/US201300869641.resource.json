	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The germination requirements of Brassica juncea (L. Czern) var. Ensabi were studied under control conditions in the laboratory. The treatment included two light levels (12:12 h light:dark period and 24-h dark environment) and five temperature regimes (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35째C) using a completely randomized blockdesign. Germination rate and germination capacity increased significantly with increasing temperature from 15 to 35째C for all treatments to an optimum of 25-30째C and decreased after 35째C. Germination was not sensitive to different light regimes. Fresh and dry seeds subjected to all chemical media irrespective of temperature regimes in darkness and light failed to germinate."}
