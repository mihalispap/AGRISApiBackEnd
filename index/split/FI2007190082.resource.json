	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Every natural system is self purifying. This is made possible by the diverse micro- and macroflora and -fauna in soils. Bacteria and fungi constitute the greatest population in soils implying that in the case of pollution, microbes are the major agents of purification. A study was carried out in situ with Nigerian crude oil (Bonny light) in polluted teak soil using axenic cultures of bacteria and fungi, a mix culture of bacteria and fungi and a mixed culture of genetically engineered bacteria (Bacillus sp.) and a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The ability to degrade crude oil was measured directly (spectrophotometrically) by oil disappearance and indirectly by the amount of CO2 produced in a controlled environment. Results showed that mixed cultures of the isolated bacteria and fungi degraded the crude oil in the teak soil better than axenic cultures by about 85% over a month period. This is a reduction of the pollution to less than 15%, while the genetically engineered mix culture (mutant Bacillus sp. and Asp. niger) degraded crude oil in a similar soil and condition by 99.3% over the same period, thus reducing pollution to less than 1% and can be applied in bioremediation."}
