The quantification of specific cherry fruit quality parameters is of high importance in the orientation of the decision-making process at every production step, from the choice of cultivar and agricultural practices to be applied, to the determination of harvest date, always geared towards ultimate consumer satisfaction. This review discusses opportunities for fruit quality evaluation and improvement."}
