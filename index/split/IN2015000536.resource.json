Very encouraging results were obtained in repeated trials. Period of spawn run and pin head initiation was found to be reduced in P. sajor-caju with 1% coelomic fluid treatment, however P. cornucopiae and P. opuntiae did not show any effect on spawn run and pin heads initiation period. The data also revealed that the addition of coelomic fluid and nutriwash @ 1 and 5 %, respectively in the wheat straw significantly increased the yield of (Pleurotus florida, P. sajor-caju, P. cornucopiae &P. opuntiae) in the range of 11.7 to 18.4% in different species of oyster mushroom in comparison to control.",
