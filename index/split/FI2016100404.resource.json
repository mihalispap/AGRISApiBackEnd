	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Ornamental fish and pond water samples from 17 ornamental fish farms in Trinidad were cultured for Salmonella spp. following enrichment of fish slurry and water samples. The antibiotic sensitivity of Salmonella isolates was determined by the disc diffusion method. Of the 560 fish sampled, 13 (2.3%) were positive for Salmonella spp. while only one (0.9%) of 111 pond water cultured was contaminated by the pathogen. Of a total of 14 isolates of Salmonella, 13 (92.8%) were S. javiana and 1 (7.2%) was S. aberdeen. Isolates were least resistant to sulphamethoxazole trimethoprim (7.1%) and norfloxacin (7.1%) while they were most resistant to oxytetracycline (78.6%) and neomycin (100%). The presence of antibiotic resistant Salmonella present in ornamental fish and their pond waters may constitute a public health hazard."}
