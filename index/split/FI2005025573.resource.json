	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Double-haploid plantlets derived from anther culture of wheat are useful breeding materials. However, efficiency of androgenesis needs improvement. We studied the androgenetic ability of five wheat cultivars that are adapted to the Jordan environment. Genotypes significantly affected anther response and callus production. Callus induction frequency was 3.6, 3.1, 2.3, 1.6 and 1.5% for cultivars Acsad 65, Hourani Nawawi, Hourani 27, F8 and Deir Alla respectively. Green plantlet regeneration was influenced significantly by cultivar. The highest frequency was produced by cultivar Acsad 65. Albino plantlets were produced by cultivars Hourani Nawawi and Acsad 65."}
