In case of rust mite, % infestation of Nagpur mandarin fruits was significantly less at dose 2.5% (8.1-14.8% infested fruits) than other treatments (20.0 - 55.8% infested fruits) but was on par with the dose 2.0 % (10.3-16.6% infested fruits). As citrus thrips and rust mites occurred together on citrus fruits, a spraying schedule using Mak All Season HMO @ 2.0% to simultaneously control both pests can now be developed based on the present investigation.",
