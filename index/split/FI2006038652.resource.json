	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Effect of cotton (trap crop) plant population in the control of Striga hermonthica using a susceptible maize hybrid (test crop) was studied in 1998 and 1999 under greenhouse conditions in a complete randomized design with three replications. The treatment combination; cotton varieties (SAMCOT- 8, SAMCOT-10, TAMCOT-CAMD-E and TXCDP37HH-1-83) at 2, 4 and 6 population density/ pot significantly influence Striga count, days to Striga emergence, plant height, damage score and total maize dry weight. SAMCOT-8 at 2, 4 and 6 population density reduced Striga count and delayed Striga emergence, while TAMCOT- CAMD-E, SAMCOT-10 and SAMCOT-8 at high population density (4 and 6/pot) reduced maize damage score. Higher total maize dry weight was obtained in all treatment involving TAMCOT-CAMD-E than other treatment combination involving the rest cotton varieties. Low and non-significant effect of Striga damage on maize was recorded."}
