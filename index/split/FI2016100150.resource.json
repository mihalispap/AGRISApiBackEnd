	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"This study assessed the effect of ferrous sulfate alone or with Na2EDTA on iron and zinc indices in 25 female students suffering from iron deficiency anemia. Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups receiving white bread fortified with ferrous sulfate alone (N=13) or in combination with Na2EDTA (N=12). Subjects consumed one loaf bread (78 g wheat flour) per day containing 10 mg of iron for two months. Blood samples were collected after one and two months for hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and zinc rate. Changes in hemoglobin for groups of ferrous sulfate only and ferrous sulfate plus Na2EDTA were 9±2.5 g l -1 and 18±2.2 g l -1(p<0.001), respectively after the second month. Transferrin saturation was 4.5±1.4 percent versus 10.6±1.8(p<0.001) and serum ferritin 1.6±1.3 µg l-1 versus 2.3± 1.1µg l-1 (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed in serum zinc between the two groups. Iron stores were 4±0.9 mmol and 6.1 ±0.5 mmol (p<0.001). It is concluded that fortifying bread with ferrous sulfate together with Na2EDTA is a suitable strategy for combating iron deficiency anemia."}
