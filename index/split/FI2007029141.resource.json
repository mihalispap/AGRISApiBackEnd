	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Several protein families that contribute to the defence mechanisms of food plants have members which are allergens or putative allergens. Cross-reactivity between pollens, fruit and vegetables relies upon pan-allergens: pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, profilins and enzymes with the same functional activity. A number of plant-derived allergens and PR-like proteins found in various species all over the plant kingdom are homologous proteins responsible for cross reactivities between different allergen sources. A considerable percentage of identified plant allergens can be grouped to the families 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 14 of pathogenesis-related proteins. Characteristics of these PR groups are reviewed in this paper."}
