	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The cultivation of grafted plants have gradually increased in the last years. As the use of this technique spread, the aims also expanded until today when grafting serves a spectrum of purposes: (1) to boost plant growth and development; (2) to control wilt caused by pathogens; (3) to reduce viral, fungal and bacterial infection; (4) to strengthen tolerance to thermal or saline stress; (5) to increase nutrient and mineral uptake to the shoot, etc. Throughout this review, we have examined the advantages of grafting plants for current agriculture, these being: resistance to evermore frequent soil diseases; tolerance of low temperatures characteristic of many latitudes of the world where intensive cultivation is economically important; tolerance to the growing problem of salinity from abuse of chemical fertilizers and desertification in many agricultural zones; and enhanced water and inorganic-nutrient uptake. All these advantages provide motivation for grafting in present-day world agriculture."}
