	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Gastroenteritis infections due to Salmonella species caused significant morbidity and mortality at 3 Tunisian hospitals from February 2000 through July 2000. Infective baby powder milk is the main cause of this epidemiology. The recovery of injured Salmonella was experimentally obtained by long-term incubation in nutrient broth and also, by gastrointestinal tracts passage into mice. The germ appeared in several organs (stomach, intestines, liver and lungs)."}
