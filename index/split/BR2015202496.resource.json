	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The experiment was carried out aiming to evaluate the plant propagation of A. dentata through cutting process with indol-butyric acid (IBA) under different seasons and cutting types, in Bom Jesus County, Piaui State, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with treatmentsdistributed in a factorial arrangement (4 x 3 x 2) referring to IBA doses (0, 1000, 3000 e 5000 mg kg-1), cutting types (apical, median and basal) and year season (rainy and dry period). The following variables were evaluated for cuttings: rooting percentage, survival percentage, number of buds, length of longer root (cm), dry mass of shoots (g) and roots (g). The 1000 mg kg-1 IBA dose could be indicated for cutting propagation of A. dentata. Apical and median cutting are themost recommended for seedling production. Rainy season is the the most favorable for seedling production of A. dentata by cuttings.",
