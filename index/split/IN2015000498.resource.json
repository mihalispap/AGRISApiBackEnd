All the treatments were effective in controlling H. armigera. Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 60 g.a.i. ha-1 was effective treatment for Helicoverpa management as this resulted higher grain yield and more return based on B: C ratio. HaNPV @ 400 LE was least effective treatment compared to other new insecticide molecules, but it was on par with a conventional insecticide, endosulfan 35 EC @ 350 g.a.i. ha-1 at all stages of management",
