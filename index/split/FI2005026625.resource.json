	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Chemical properties of water sources for cassava processing in selected areas of Southwest Nigeria were evaluated. Water samples were aseptically collected from Ilaro, Ibadan and Abeokuta using sterile containers and analyzed for chemical properties. There were significant differences (P< 0.05) between sampling sites for organic matter (0.2-8.6 mg/l), BOD5 (0.3-3.1 mg/l), COD (3.3-6.7 mg/l), total solids (56.0-108.6 mg/l), suspended solids (21.5 â€“ 48.3 mg/l), nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, sodium, potassium and chloride in water samples. The study showed that processing environment has significant effect on pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, organic matter, BOD5 ,COD, OM, total solids and suspended solids within the processing locations."}
