	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Laboratory studies on the biology of painted bug (Bagrada hilaris Burm.) revealed that the mean number of eggs laid by a female were 70.8 Â± 6.1 on soaked mustard seeds. The average preoviposition period, incubation period, nymphal period and total developmental period was found as 6.2 Â± 0.11 days, 3.6 Â± 0.09,16.2 Â± 0.57 days and 18.6 Â± 0.36 days, respectively. Two peaks of painted bug population were observed i.e. first in 49th standard week (6.5 painted bug/meter row length) and 12th standard week (9.7 painted bug/plant). B. hilaris population was found positively significantly correlated with maximum temperature (r=0.420), evaporation (r=0.455) and wind speed (r=0.422) while negatively significantly correlated with relative humidity (r=-0.424). Malathion 50EC @ 500ml/500 litre of water was found most effective (84.40% mean reduction after 10 days of spray). The highest incremental cost benefit ratio of 1:11.7 was obtained in malathion 50 EC @ 500ml/500 litre of water followed by endosulfan 4% dust @ 10 kg/ha (1:11.1) and endosulfan 35 EC @ 500ml/500 litre of water (1:11.0).",
