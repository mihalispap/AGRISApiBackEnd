	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Family poultry (FP), which are still very important in low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs), have been kept by local communities for many generations. These birds usually make up more than 80% of the national poultry flock in many LIFDCs. Although requiring low levels of inputs, FP are a valuable asset to local populations, especially in underprivileged groups and less favoured areas. FP represent an appropriate system to provide additional income to the generally resource-poor small farmers, especially women, to supply the fast-growing human population with high quality protein, hence their significant contribution to poverty alleviation, food security and the overall well-being of household's members. Nevertheless, there is a strong need for governments, non-governmental organizations, international agencies and donors to design, implement, monitor and evaluate FP development programmes by taking socio-cultural issues into account."}
