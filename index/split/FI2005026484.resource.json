	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Cowpea, an annual legume can be valued as a nutritional supplement to cereals in the semi-arid region of Africa. Fortunately, it tolerates heat and dry conditions and can be grown under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions to boost its low level of production. A study was conducted in the dry seasons of 2001, 2002 and 2003 at Kadawa (11°39’N, 08°02’E ), Nigeria to evaluate the effects of irrigation methods (basin or furrow), irrigation levels (7, 14 or 21-day intervals) and N-P2O5-K2O fertilizer levels (0-0-0, 20-40-20 and 0-40-0) on the performance of cowpea. The growth and yield components were influenced at varying levels by the factors. The use of furrow irrigation method resulted in higher yield, and delay in irrigation up to 14-21 days did not significantly affect the yield. The response to fertilizer levels was significant only in 2003. The result has positive implication on efficient use of resources (water and fertilizer) in irrigated cowpea production in the region."}
