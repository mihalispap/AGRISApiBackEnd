	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The aim of the study was to determine whether short-term salt stress increases concentration of cytoplasmic Ca²+ ([Ca²+]cyt) by activating the enzyme Ca²+-calmodulin-dependent nicotinamide adenide dinucleotide kinase (Ca²+-CaM-NAD kinase; EC 2.1.7.23), and whether these stress-induced variations trigger changes in the adaptive response of plants, as in proline metabolism. To address this question, we subjected 15-d-old green bean plants to salt stress (250 mM of NaCl) for 3 h. Plants showed foliar accumulation of proline, defining the enzymes Δ¹-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS; EC 2.7.2.11/1.2.2.41) and proline dehydrogenase (PDH; EC 1.5.99.8) as determinant in the foliar accumulation of this amino acid during salt stress. In addition, we found a close relationship between Ca²+-CaM-dependent NAD kinase and proline metabolism, suggesting that the adaptive responses or acclimation of plants under salt stress are preceded by an increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca²+."}
