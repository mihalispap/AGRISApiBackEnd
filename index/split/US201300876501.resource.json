	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Gamma irradiation adversely affected the accumulation of soluble sugars along with the activities of hydrolytic enzymes in three species of plantago, namely Plantago lanceolata, Plantago major and Plantago ovata. Gamma rays (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 krad) when applied pre-sowingly to dry seeds from a cobalt 60Co source at a dose rate of 233.5 rad/min significantly reduced the accumulation of reducing, non-reducing and total soluble sugars in comparison with un-irradiated control. It also significantly repressed the activities of Î±-amylase and invertase in the developed seedlings. Soaking irradiated seeds with the growth regulator gibberellic acid (20 ppm) partially alleviated the adverse effects of irradiation. It reversed the depression in the level of soluble sugars and activities of the hydrolytic enzymes. The magnitude of the reversal decreased with the increase of the dose of irradiation. The three species varied in their response to irradiation and to gibberellic acid post-treatment. Involvement of GA3 in inducing tolerance to plantago seedlings to irradiation stress is discussed."}
