	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The present work was performed to evaluate the hypolipidemic effect of two untraditional vegetable oils, i.e. rocket and borage oils, in addition to the effect of one traditional edible oil (olive oil) in hyperlipidemic rats.The three tested oils led to a significant decrease in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, total lipids, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and LDL/HDL ratio. Moreover, cholesterol and total lipids of liver in hyperlipidemic rats were reduced by the treatment with the three oils. High density lipoprotein (HDL) elevated significantly in the treated rats by any of the three oils. Histological studies on liver tissues of hyperlipidemic rats demonstrated variable degrees of improvement of fatty degeneration in rats treated with the three oils as compared to hyperlipidemic control rats. Borage oil as compared to olive oil showed more pronounce effect in lowering the above lipid parameters."}
