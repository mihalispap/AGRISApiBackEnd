These opinions are likely to differ, particularly in relation to such issues as: the role that should be played by livestock; the extent to which Western technologies should be used in these livestock industries; and whether the existing level of available knowledge concerning the livestock industries of developing Asia is adequate for policy development. This paper addresses these and related issues."}
