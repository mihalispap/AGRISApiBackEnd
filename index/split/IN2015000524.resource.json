Two applications of tebuconazole 25EC + amalgerol @ 500ml and 2000ml/ha gave very effective control of tikka leaf spot and rust and where terminal PDI was 06.1 and 09.1, respectively. Amalgerol regulating the disease incidence was environmentally safe and economically beneficial. Results also indicated that amalgerol in combination with tebuconazole offered resistance to the invasion of disease causing pathogen.",
