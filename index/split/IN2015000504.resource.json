	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The studies were conducted on the safety of emamectin benzoate 5 WG (EB) to eggs, larvae and adults of Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi. The highest egg hatchability was recorded in EB 5 WG @ 5 (93.3%) and 6.25 g a.i/ha (91.0%), followed by EB 5 WG @ 7.5 (87.6%). At 48 hrs after treatment, the lowest larval mortality was recorded in EB 5 WG @ 5 (14.0%) and 6.25 g a.i. ha-1 (16.6%) in larval feeding method. In dry film method at 48 hrs, the lowest % mortality of 15.0 was recorded in EB 5 WG @ 5 followed by 18.3% at 6.25 g a.i. ha-1. Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 30 g a.i. ha-1 registered the highest larval mortality (45.0%), while untreated check recorded no mortality. Adult longevity was the highest in untreated check (15.33 days), followed by EB 5 WG @ 5 (12.60 days) and 6.25 g a.i. ha-1 (11.33 days). Number of eggs laid/5 females was also greater in untreated check (368.33 eggs) when compared to EB 5 WG @ 5 (144.33 eggs) and 6.25 g a.i. ha-1 (138.00 eggs).",
