	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The prevalence of repeat breeding (RB) was calculated retrospectively for a period of 6 years from 2005 to 2010. The overall prevalence of RB was recorded as 28.31%. Prevalence of repeat breeding was although found to vary from 1st to 5th parity, but the difference was non-significant. However, significantly lowest prevalence was recorded at  6th (6.25%) when compared to other parities. Prevalence of RB with respect to breed, season and different years were found nonsignificant. Ovulatory disturbances (27.30%), ovarian cysts (7.89%) and metritis (18.09%) contributed as some of the major causes of repeat breeding in cattle of rural Kashmir.",
