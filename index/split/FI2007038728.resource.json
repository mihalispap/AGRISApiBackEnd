	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Leaching of water and nutrients was studied in intensive tomato crop cultivation in a polyethylene greenhouse with drop irrigation under Mediterranean conditions. Leaching of water, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and chloride were estimated under three different fertirrigation management methods (Ta time irrigation, Tb constant nutritive solution, irrigation according to ETc and crop extractions and Tc irrigation by means of tensiometers and water retention curve for the soil and nutritive solution according to the levels of nutrients in the water solution).The efficiency of the different fertilizers and water applied has been evaluated as well as the productive efficiency as opposed to the contamination levels generated by the crop. Treatments B and C reduced considerably the quantities of leaching and improved the production efficiency in relation to the contamination level that was generated."}
