	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The cyber extension system focuses the overall development of the farms including production, management, marketing and other rural developmental activities, thus conceptualizing an extension communication model and defining anything that can be fit into this model, as cyber communication was felt necessary to explain the framework for the study of internet communication. The Cyber Extension Communication model centers around information received by farm owners from different sources and the same can also be simplified by easy to follow text and audio-visual illustrations in local languages and can be displayed on bulletin board at kiosks. In Cyber Extension Communication model, the information transmission from the source to community information centers will be under public domain, while from community information centers to farmers the information is available under private domain. The potential advantages of Cyber Extension Communication are continuously available, information rich, instant international reach, receiver-oriented approach, individualism and saves money, time and efforts."}
