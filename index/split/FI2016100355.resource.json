	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Levels of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were determined in landfill leachate samples from Qurain landfill site. Over twelve month study period (January to December 2003), levels at the Qurain landfill site were: pH 7.8-9.40; total dissolved solids (TDS) 3.59-21.90 mg/l; conductivity 1.83 to 36.50 µs/cm; salinity 1-22.30‰; Cl 0.5-13.63 mg/l ; S 0.1-2.31 mg/l; N 0-6.8 mg/l; P 0.13 to 6.88 mg/l; total carbon 212-4376 mg/l; Ca 14.5-437 mg/l; Cd < 0.05-0.05 mg/l; Co <0.05-0.05 mg/l; Cr 0.05-0.7 mg/l; Cu < 0.05- 0.05 mg/l; Fe 0.1- 9.4 mg/l; Hg 0.1-1.2 mg/l; Mg 0.05-0.17 mg/l; Na 361-4450 mg/l; Ni 0.05-0.28 mg/l; Pb 0.05-0.12 mg/l; Zn 0.05-0.9 mg/l. The study helped to understand the behavior of various pollutants present in the landfill leachate and the extent of pollution. At present, the leachate site may not exhibit any significant accumulation of contamination. However, the results of the study indicate that further long-term monitoring program should be implemented for the Qurain site."}
