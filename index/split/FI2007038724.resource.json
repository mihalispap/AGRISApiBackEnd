	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"This study examined the trends in revenue system collections and forestry development in Ondo State of Nigeria with a view to determining the annual rate of changes between 1991 and 2000 and their impacts on sustainable forest management. The study made use of secondary and time series data on forest fees, expenditure and allocation. Data were analyzed using the descriptive and inferential statistics. There exists a strong positive correlation (r = 0.91) between the projected and actual revenue for ten years under investigation. The amount released for forest development between 1991 and 2000 was deficient. The 25% Forestry Trust Fund in seven years (1994-2000) to be allocated to Forestry Department was not met. This had a negative impact on renewal programme of the state. It is recommended that the strategies for improved fiscal policies to sustainable forestry development should encompass technical/economic, institutional and political constituents. There is the need for a change in planning style. Emphasis must shift from timber production to non-wood products."}
