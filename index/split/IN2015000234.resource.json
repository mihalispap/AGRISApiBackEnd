Management of chick pea collar rot with bioagents, fungicides and oilseed cakes were evaluated against S. rolfsii in pot culture. Among the treatments, T9 recorded lowest disease incidence of 6.2 and this treatment also recorded maximum plant height 30.9 (cm), root length (8.9cm), maximum fresh weight of shoot (11.4g) and root (1.6 g) and maximum dry weight of shoot (0.3 g) and root (0.1 g).",
