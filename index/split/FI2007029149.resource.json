	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Carrots were stored for 7, 14, or 21 days at temperatures of –2, 0, 8 and 15°C. Texture characterization was done with a puncture test. A Lloyd Universal Testing Machine was used to drive the 7.94 mm cylindrical punch at a constant speed of 25 mm•min-1 at mid length of the carrot samples. The parameters used for the analysis were: the force at failure, the displacement, the work and the slope of the load-displacement curve between 50 and 150 N. Carrot length, mass, diameter at mid-length and moisture content were also recorded. The statistical analysis indicated that the slope of the load-displacement curve was the most discriminating parameter to compare the texture of carrots stored for different period of time and at different temperatures."}
