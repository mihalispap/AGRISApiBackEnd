	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The Hakra civilization, which flourished was one of the longest in the course of world history. Cholistan is the only place where the remnants of the oldest settlements are still intact because of the desertion of the river Hakra. Archaeological ruined remains present in Cholistan indicate that water availability in the area was higher centuries ago. The reduction of vegetation to about one third or less of its historical cover most probably results in considerably higher near surface and surface temperature. As a result, evaporation of the scarce rainfall has increased considerably during the last decades so reducing the effective rainfall available for range and groundwater recharge, which is well known as self-reinforcing aspect of desertification. The aridity in Cholistan is rightly seen as a major limitation to wide-scale range improvement and management programmes. Archaeobotanical evidences suggest that the nuclear area of Indus-Saraswati civilization was located around the Saraswati River. There was a westward movement of crops domesticated in India to Harappa and to sites in Kashmir and Balochistan during the early and mature phases of Indus-Saraswati civilization. High agricultural prosperity was witnessed during the mature phase when crop rotation was practiced. However, during the late phase, with the drying of the Saraswati River, agricultural communities moved eastwards to Ganga valley and southwards to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra."}
