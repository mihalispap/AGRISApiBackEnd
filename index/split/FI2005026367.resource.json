	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A new concept using reverse osmosis to enrich solid contents in the food and subsequently encapsulating the free moisture within the food using additive resulted in extension of shelf-life of pineapples. The sample prepared by this new technique is better in look, texture and accepted by the taste panelists over the conventionally prepared freeze-dried sample. Sample was stored up to 6 months at room temperature and 1 year in 0-2Â°C without much appreciable change in the acceptance. The method adopted was found to be suitable in preservation of large varieties of fruits."}
