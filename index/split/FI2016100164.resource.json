	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"This paper compares the cost of three labour sources namely, farm labour, animal traction and tractor hiring. The comparison is predicated on the policy issue that may affect labour usage in agricultural production. Data were obtained from secondary sources and comparisons were made across the states and the labour sources. The result of the study shows that Adamawa State has the highest cost of farm labour, Katsina for animal traction and Bauchi for tractor hiring. Significant differences were recorded for the cost of farm labour animal traction and tractor hiring. F = 25.2 p < 0.05. Similarly significant differences occur in the cost of farm labour (F = 2.92 P p < 0.05) and animal traction (F = 3.49 p < 0.05) but not tractor hiring (F = 1.99; p > 0.05) among the states. The paper concludes on the policy implications of homogenous technology for heterogeneous clients."}
