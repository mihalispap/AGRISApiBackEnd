	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The design and construction of hazardous waste landfill facility to accommodate hazardous wastes generated by petrochemical and non-petrochemical companies in the Shuaiba Industrial Area (SIA) are presented. The facility is designed in a way to prevent migration of leachate produced by the wastes either into the groundwater or atmosphere. The facility is essentially square in shape with HPDE liner with overall dimensions of approximately 125 m x 125 m at a nominal depth of 13 m. The capacity of the hazardous waste landfill including the volume under the mounted cover is approximately 135,000 m3. The design and construction of such a full-scale facility is presented."}
