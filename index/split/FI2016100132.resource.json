	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Seedlings of aubergine (Solanum melongena L.) “Rima” were grafted onto two tomato rootstocks, “Primavera” (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and “Heman” (Lycopersicon hirsutum). Grafted and non-grafted (control) plants were grown in the field and greenhouse. Plants grafted onto “Heman” (RH) produced 53% and 60% more fruit than the control (R) in the greenhouse and field respectively, whereas the yield of plants grafted onto “Primavera” (RP) was similar to that of the control. Grafted plants (RH and RP) were more vigorous than the non-grafted R, as indicated by their higher plant height, main stem and leaf weight. This led to earlier harvest. The seed content of fruit from grafted plants was lower than that of the control, indicating better fruit quality."}
