	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Granular cassava, corn, high amylose corn, potato, Indica, and Japonica rice, wheat, and waxy corn starches were exposed to corona discharges. The discharges decomposed starches abstracting low molecular fragments from terminals of long polysaccharide chains. The fragments were split from the chains of polysaccharides constituting high-, medium-, and low-molecular fractions of starches. Apart from the fragmentation of the polysaccharide chains oxidation of the polysaccharides took place. Mineral salts inhibited the fragmentation of starches."}
