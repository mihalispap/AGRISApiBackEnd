	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Half-fermented trout or “rakfisk” from Valdres will be one of the first locally branded product for which Norwegian “Protected Designation of Origin” status is to be sought. This product has evolved gradually over the last fifteen years, and this case study intends to focus specifically on “rakfisk from Valdres”, in order to understand better the local food system in a Norwegian context. This article is based on Tregear’s triangle, which analyses typical local food products from three complementary perspectives: a social dimension, a marketing aspect and a rural development politic. Following an introduction, presenting the context of the study and the actual product, we will focus on Tregear’s triangle and emphasize some specificity peculiar to Norway. Consideration will also be made of the relationships between producers and policy-makers on the one hand, and producers and consumers on the other. Finally we will demonstrate the huge distinctions between an ideological and a practical view of the product."}
