	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Citrus fruits are rich in secondary metabolites such as carotenoids, flavonoids and limonoids. Recent studies show that these secondary metabolites possess potential health benefits for humans, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Due to these properties, biochemical studies of citrus secondary metabolites have been intensively investigated. However, our knowledge on the molecular aspects of the biosynthesis of these compounds has been limited. Some of the genes involved in the flavonoid and limonoid biosynthesis have been isolated from citrus. In this review, we report on the expression of flavonoid- and limonoid-biosynthetic genes in citrus towards pharmacological applications and breeding using a molecular technique."}
