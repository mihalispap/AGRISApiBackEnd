	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The life table of Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was calculated on Planococcus citri (Risso (Homoptera: Coccidae) under laboratory conditions at 25±1°C and 45±5% relative humidity after different storage periods at 15°C of cooling. Experiments consisted of 5 groups including a control and design experiments that were run for 5, 10, 15 and 20 days, respectively. The following predictive parameters were obtained for the control and design experiments: intrinsic rate of increase rm = 0.098, 0.092, 0.074, 0.058 and 0.045; net reproductive rate R0 = 340.703, 276.629, 149.930, 119.321 and 65.928; mean generation time T0  = 59.350, 60.851, 67.726, 83.189 and 94.173, respectively. Doubling time DT = 7.2, 7.9, 9.3, 12.1 and 15.3, and finite rate of increment λ = 1.101, 1.092, 1.074, 1.059 and 1.046, were calculated as well. The reproductive value (Vx) for each group was plotted."}
