	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Lactobacillus plantarum UG1 grew in whey permeate (WP) and produced the bacteriocin plantaricin UG1, although the biomass and bacteriocin titres were lower than those obtained in the control MRS medium. Upon enrichment of WP by yeast extract and some mineral salts, L. plantarum UG1 gave comparable values of growth and plantaricin UG1 activity. The enriched WP medium was designated whey permeate–yeast extract–mineral salts (WYM).The composition of this medium is indicated in the text. The dynamics of plantaricinUG1 biosynthesis by L. plantarum UG1 were studied in WYM medium in batch fermentation processes. Maximum plantaricin UG1 activity was obtained in WYM medium when the producer organism was in the late exponential and in the early stationary phase of growth. Titres of plantaricin UG1 in WYM medium were almost 9% higher in pH-controlled than in pH-uncontrolled fermentations."}
