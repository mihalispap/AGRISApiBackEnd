	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Rhizomatous buds of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. – a medicinally important aromatic herb – were cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with plant growth regulators for inducing microshoots. Explants inoculated in 4.44 µM 6- benzylaminopurine (BAP) showed 100% response giving both multiple shoots (70%) and single shoots (30%). However, single shoots were induced in higher percentage (80%) in 2.32 µM kinetin supplemented medium. The most effective media for multiplication of microshoots were MS media fortified with 0.54 µM α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 4.44 µM BAP and 2.69 µM NAA and 4.44 µM BAP producing at the rate of 8 microshoots per explant. Microrhizomes were observed at the base of all in vitro derived shoots cultured on the media supplemented with a range of sucrose concentration (3-9%) within eight weeks of incubation. The best responses in terms of number (up to 6 microrhizomes per culture tube) were obtained in the media supplemented with 7 and 9% sucrose. Average fresh weight of 0.81g was observed in MS medium supplemented with 5% sucrose."}
