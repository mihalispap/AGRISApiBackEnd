	{"value":"however, the small amount of radioactive source they include is no longer desirable since it makes recycling more complicated where the people encountered with radioactive waste. In this study, a conventional ionization type smoke sensor which contained americium-241 radioactive source modelled by Monte Carlo MCNPX code. The absorbed dose rate is calculated by MCNPX code where the human tissue meddled as a soft tissue material. The dosimetry results are comparable with the experimental safety margins. It concluded that if the ionization smoke sensors positioned at a right distance from the human body, so the radiation risk and the exposure hazard can be lower than the exposure level of the background radiation."}
