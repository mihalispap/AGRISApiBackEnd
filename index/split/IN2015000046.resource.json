	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"In vitro assays on the compatibility of recommended doses of synthetic and botanical pesticides with the fungal pathogen Hirsutella sp., infecting root mealybug, Geococcus citrinus Kuwana revealed that, all pesticides affected the mycelial growth, of these phorate and botanicals had a lesser effect. Even 10 days after inoculation, cent per cent inhibition was exhibited by carbendazim and quinalphos. Carbaryl and chlorpyriphos recorded 53.17 and 51.64% inhibition respectively followed by dimethoate (34.17%). Per cent inhibition in botanicals was comparatively less (26.17% in econeem and 27.59% in pongamia oil). Only 13.13% inhibition in growth of the pathogen was observed in phorate and hence it can be considered as compatible with Hirsutella sp.",
