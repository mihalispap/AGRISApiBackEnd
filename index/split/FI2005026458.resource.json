	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Changes in viability and vigour in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus T.) seeds stored at high temperature (45°C) and high relative humidity (100%) for 0, 3, 5, and 7 days were observed. Storage at 45°C and high humidity caused severe damage to seed membranes as evidenced by loss of viability and an increase in electrical conductivity (EC) values. There was a positive correlation (r² = 0.89) between germination capacity and EC measured in seeds aged acceleratedly for 7 days. Germination percentage and radicle length decreased while germination speed, time to 50% germination and electrical conductivity increased with the passage of ageing time. These differences are indicative of an increase in the proportion of deteriorated seeds and with loss of membrane integrity."}
