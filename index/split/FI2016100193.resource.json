	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"In an attempt to provide an agenda for sustainable agricultural development, the aim of this paper is to use Galileo methodology to illustrate the attitudes of Agricultural Organization (Jehad-e-Keshavarzi) specialists of two southern province of Iran towards the basic premises of Ecological Modernization (EM) and De-Modernization (DM) based sustainable agricultural paradigms. Data were collected from 189 agricultural specialists using a systematic random sampling method. Cognitive maps of attitude toward the two sustainable agricultural development paradigms were developed. It is concluded that there is a great distance between present and ideal agriculture of Iran. While present Iran’s agriculture is more close to the premises of DM, agricultural specialists portray the future agricultural polices around EM-based agricultural paradigm."}
