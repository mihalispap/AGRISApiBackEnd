	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"There was a significant reduction of mite population in bifenazate 240 SC @ 0.50 ml/l (Floramite) (0.30 mites / 3 leaves) which was followed by propargite 57 EC @ 1.50 ml/l (0.30 mites / leaves) and bifenazate 240 SC @ 1.0 ml/l (1.7 mites / 3 leaves) and dicofol 25 EC @ 2.00 ml/l (1.70 mites / 3 leaves). However, all these treatments were significantly superior over untreated control. The pooled analysis of two year data indicated that there was a significant reduction of mites population in bifenazate (0.7 mites / 3 leaves), propergite (0.7 mites / 3 leaves) and abamectin (0.7 mites / 3 leaves) over other treatments. The similar trend of superiority of treatments was recorded after second spray. Significantly highest yield of grape fruits was recorded in bifenazate (15.40 kg / plant) and abamectin as compared to rest of the treatments.",
