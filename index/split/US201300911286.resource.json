	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a temperateâ€“growing annual crop that is cultivated for the oil content of its seeds or fiber production. In this research work four flax varieties (Escalina, Evelin, Ilona, Laura) were grown in field trials under two rates (single and double) of inorganic fertilization (11-15-15). After two years of experimentation (2000-2001, 2001-2002) both agronomic characteristics and yield increased in the double rate of fertilization and during the second cultivation period. It should be pointed out that this increase was in most cases statistically significant (p<0.05, L.S.D. test). Between varieties, Laura was the most productive variety in both years and in the double rate of fertilization while in the first year Escalina was the least productive variety in the two rates of fertilization. There was positive effect of double nitrate doses on LAI, root density and root surface area on all varieties. In the second year there was positive effect also on yield."}
