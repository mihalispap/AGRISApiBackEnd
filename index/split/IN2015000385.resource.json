	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"Twenty-five ejaculates (five from each of five Beetal bucks) were used to study the preservability of Beetal buck semen in three extenders viz., Tris, Tes-Tris and Egg yolk phosphate. The mean sperm motility and live sperm at 72 h of preservation at 5Â°C in Tris, Tes-Tris and Egg yolk phosphate extenders were 59.60Â±1.44 and 67.64Â±1.62, 57.40Â±1.39 and 64.46Â±1.50, 53.00Â±1.19 and 61.88Â±1.58%, respectively. The interaction between extender and hour of preservation was not significant. The mean per cent sperm motility was significantly (P0.01) higher in Tris and Tes-Tris than in Egg yolk phosphate extender and the mean per cent live sperm was significantly (P0.01) higher in Tris than Tes-Tris and Egg yolk phosphate extender. It is concluded that Tris extender is superior to Tes-Tris and Egg Yolk phosphate extender for preservation of Beetal buck semen at 5Â°C under the agro-climatic conditions of Assam.",
