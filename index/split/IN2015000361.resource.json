	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"A study was undertaken to investigate polymorphism in BMP-15 (Fec XBand Fec XG in exon-2) gene in Marwari goats by RFLP technique. Samples were collected from 60 unrelated goats of Marwari breed from different locations in Bikaner district. Genomic DNA was extracted by phenol:chloroform method and amplified using exon-2 Fec XB and Fec XG specific primers. The amplification was obtained at between 153 bp and 141 bp. The purified amplicons were digested with five base cutter restriction enzymes: DdeI and HinfI (5GANTCA 3CTNAGT). All samples showed the absence of polymorphism at the Fec XB and Fec XG loci of BMP-15 gene. Hence, BMP-15 gene cannot be regarded as the major gene associated with the fecundity of goats. Further investigation may be directed at other loci of BMP-15 gene or other genes, using larger sample size.",
