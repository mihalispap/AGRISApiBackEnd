	"bibo:abstract":{"value":"The effect of supplementation of copper and zinc on nutrient intake, utilization, blood profile and wool yield and semen quality of Malpura rams was studied. Twenty-seven adult Malpura rams (4â5 year old) were randomly divided into 3 groups of 9 each. Concentrate feed fed to rams of Group I (G-I) did not contain supplemental Zn and Cu, inorganic Zn and Cu as sulphate (50% of basal diet) and Cu and Zn methionine (25% of basal diet) was fed to Group II (G-II) and Group III (G-III) rams. Cu and Zn contents of concentrate feed, was 16.87, 34.67 ppm in G-I; 37.15, 48.56 ppm in G-II and 26.19, 39.58 ppm in G-III, respectively. Daily dry matter intake, digestible crude protein and metabolizable energy remained similar among groups. Similarly, dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre digestibility of feed did not affected by mineral supplementation. Mean serum glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, urea and cholesterol concentration were not influenced by mineral supplementation. Cu and Zn supplementation significantly (P0.01) increased the Cu and Zn concentration of serum in G-II and G-III. Semen volume increased from 0.75 in G-I to 0.89 in G-II and 0.78 ml in G-III. Similarly, mass motility on 0â5 scale also increased from 4.03 in G-I to 4.35 in G-II. However, sperm motility decreased from 82.3 in G-I to 76.7 in G-II and 67.6% in G-III. Rapid motile sperm also decreased from 73.7 in G-I to 68.5 in G-II and 56.0% in G-III. Wool yield of rams was increased by 16.89% in G-III over G-II. Cu and Zn concentration of wool samples was significantly (P0.01) increased in G-II and G-III. The body weight gain of rams did not differ significantly between the groups. The study suggested that there was no effect of Cu and Zn supplementation on nutrient intakes, digestibility, semen volume and quality except wool yield.",
